Ted Corbitt helped plan the deceptively hilly course of the New York City Marathon.[5] The initial course of 1970 consisted in repeated racing around Central Park.[6] Nowadays the course covers all five boroughs of New York City. It begins on Staten Island, in Fort Wadsworth, near the approach to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The bridge, which normally carries only vehicular traffic, is closed for the event. Runners use both sides of the upper level of the bridge and the westbound side of the lower level. In the opening minutes of the race, the bridge is filled with runners, creating a dramatic spectacle that is closely associated with the event.\n\nAfter descending the bridge, the course winds through Brooklyn, mostly along Fourth Avenue and Bedford Avenue, for approximately the next 11 miles (18 km). Runners pass through a variety of neighborhoods, including: Bay Ridge, Sunset Park, Park Slope, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, and Greenpoint.\n\nAt 13.1 miles (21.1 km), runners cross the Pulaski Bridge, marking the halfway point of the race and the entrance into Long Island City, Queens. After about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) in Queens, runners cross the East River via the Queensboro Bridge into Manhattan. It is at this point in the race when many runners begin to tire, as the climb up the bridge is considered one of the most difficult points in the marathon.\n\nReaching Manhattan after about 16 miles (26 km), the race proceeds north on First Avenue, then crosses briefly into The Bronx via the Willis Avenue Bridge for a mile before returning into Manhattan via the Madison Avenue Bridge. It then proceeds south through Harlem down Fifth Avenue and into Central Park. At the southern end of the park, the race proceeds across Central Park South, where thousands of spectators cheer runners on during the last mile. At Columbus Circle, the race re-enters the park and finishes outside Tavern on the Green. The time limit for this course is 8½ hours from the 10:10 a.m. start."

If you keep a steady pace, you can get to the top of the trail and reach the Hollywood Sign in about 45 minutes. Be sure the bring plenty of water with you especially during the summer, since it gets very hot. \nHollywood Sign Trail\n\nWalk until you reach another Hollyridge Trail sign. Follow the sign and go left. You have began your journey to the Hollywood sign.\nHollyridge Trail Sign with Graffiti\n\nContinue walking. You will see beautiful scenery to your right. \nHollywood Sign Trail\n\nOn your left you will see the Hollywood sign. You are still far away from reaching it.\nHollywood Sign\n\nHold your nose! On the first part of the trail you will encounter lots and lots of horse poop.\nHollywood Sign Horse Poop\n\nPay attention! This is the most important part of the journey. The trail will split. The main road will continue straight. The trail leading to the Hollywood Sign will sharply turn left. You will be relieved, the horse poop ends here. The horses will continue going straight.\nHollywood Sign\n\nAnother angle of the split. The person in the picture is coming down. You wil be going up. \nHollywood Sign\n\nThe road will continue to curve. Just keep going up.\nHollywood Sign Trail\n\nThis is shortcut. However, it is very steep and I recommend that you stay on the main road.\nHollywood Sign Shortcut\n\nYou will once again see the Hollywood sign on your left side. However, when the road comes to a fork do not make a left, go to the right.\nHollywood Sign\n\nMake a right when the road ends. This will seem like you are walking away from the Hollywood sign.\nHollywood Sign\n\nA closer look at where you have to make a right. This is the last time you have to pay attention. The rest of the trail to the Hollywood sign is a no brainer, just follow the trail.\nHollywood Sign\n\nAfter the fork the road will curve again. Continue going up. You are about half way there.\nHollywood Sign\n\nThere will be some cool wild plants that you will encounter on the way.\nHollywood Sign Plants\n\nYou may also encounter some wild life like this lizzard. \nHollywood Sign Lizzard\n\nFrom this part of the trail, you have an amazing view of the city and the freeway.\nHollywood Sign View\n\nOn a clear day, you can see miles away. \nHollywood Sign City View\n\nThe Hollywood Sign will still be on your left, however just continue on the road upwards.\nHollywood Sign on Left Side\n\nThe views towards the last third of the way to the Hollywood Sign are breathtaking. \nHollywood Sign Breathtaking Views\n\nYou are almost at the Hollywood Sign. All you have to do is make to the other side of the hill.\nHollywood Sign Almost There\n\nA cool tree on the way that has its roots going through the side of the mountain.\nHollywood Sign Cool Tree\n\nThe Hollywood Sign is just around the corner. \nHollywood Sign Around the Corner\n\nWhen you see the fence, you have made it! You are steps away from the Hollywood Sign.\nHollywood Sign Fence\n\nFrom here, you can already see the Hollywood Sign. Take a deep breath, you are bout to witness one of the most well known landmarks in the world.\nHollywood Sign Fence\n\nThis is how close legally you can get to the Hollywood Sign.\nHollywood Sign Fence\n\nYou have made it. The Hollywood Sign is here!\nHollywood Sign From Behind\n\nThe Hollywood Sign is so large that it is difficult to photograph the whole sign at once.\nHollwyood Sign From Behind\n\nAnother view of the magnificent Hollywood Sign.\nHollywood Sign From Behind\n\nEntry to get next to the Hollywood sign is restricted.\nHollywood Sign Restricted Entry\n\nI know what you are thinking. Who is going to catch me. Well, there are many cameras pointing towards the Hollywood Sign.\nHollywood Sign Video Cameras\n\nThere are those that cannot be stopped by cameras and are determined to reach their dreams and touch the Hollywood Sign. These pictures were sent to us anonymously. \n\n\nAnother picture sent to us anonymously. The sign is gigantic. You get a good sense of how large it is next to the boy standing."

"Travel","Croatia","http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/worlds-best-honeymoon-destinations-for-2014#!11-croatia\n\nIf you love the Mediterranean but are tired of the crowds, it’s time to visit Croatia. While it’s gaining in popularity, peak vacation periods are not nearly as frenetic as their neighbors across the Adriatic. One of the best ways to explore the Dalmatian Coast is via cruise ship. You’ll call upon places like the city of Dubrovnik, which has been a bustling seaport since the 7th century; the island of Korcula, where you can bike, snorkel, or kayak; Split with the breathtaking Diocletian’s Palace—now a UNESCO World Heritage site—that was built in 305 AD; the fishing port of Rovinj; and the quaint island of Hvar with its beaches, lavender fields, groves of olive trees, pine forests, fruit orchards, and vineyards.\n\nWhere to Stay: There is no better way to get acquainted with Croatia than via cruise ship. Try the 694-passenger Azamara Quest, which sails a 7-night round-trip itinerary from Venice that calls upon Zadar, Split, Hvar, and Dubrovnik in Croatia plus Montenegro’s Kotor. Tere Moana, the intimate 90-guest ship from Paul Gauguin Cruises also sails round-trip from Venice with calls on Sibenik, Trogir, Split, Korcula, Dubrovnik, Hvar, and Rovinj. SeaDream Yacht Club’s 112-guest SeaDream II comes to the table with a Dubrovnik to Venice 7-night cruise that calls on Korcula, Hvar, Sibenik, Rab, Pula, and Piran.\n\nPerfect for Couples Who: Want a mix of Old Europe and a traditional Mediterranean cruise that offers plenty of beach time."

Мабуть існує немало вирішень цього траблу.\n\nАле найпростіше як на мене ось:\n1) Підключитись вручну до оператора CSL або PCCW-HKT.\n2) Зателефонувати *165#.\n4) Підключитись до WiFi - ""CSL"".(До речі, його можна знайти по всьому Гонконгу і навіть під джунгями острова Лантау під всіма заборами)\n3) Kод з отриманого sms ввести у вікні браузера на вкладці- Special offer for HK visitors.\n4) Вуаля, 24 години безкоштовного інету і доволі непоганого.\nПісля 24 годин смс можна попросити знову і юзати інет далі. До речі, з ноутбука він працював тиждень і нічого не просив. Швидкість дозволяла дивитись відоси і за ніч качнути 3-4 фільма, якщо сил на бетонні і не тільки джунглі Гонконгу вже не вистачає.\nМожливо це комусь взагалі не новина, але хто зна. Австралійці, які сиділи в інтернеті від якогось магазину пару днів були цьому дужи раді.\n\nВсім привіт з Гонконгу!"

"Travel","Buy experiences vs. Things","Some purchased items can make you happy, yes, but you've probably heard that the best use of money is buying experiences instead. Our life is built around our experiences and the memory of a great vacation will stick with us a lot longer than a new smartphone. Experiences also have the perk of shaping who you are. You could learn a lot about yourself—and what you really want in life—when you opt for an awesome experience instead of a new TV that would just keep you glued to your couch. \n\nSo if you want an easy boost to your happiness, you need to get out in the world and do some new things. But you don't have to do it alone! In fact, it might even be better for you to buy experiences with others. Being social makes us happy, and investing in experiences that you can talk about later with others is a great way to do that. You get the benefits of a new experience, as well as the perks of feeling like you were involved in something special later on. Think of something of you've always wanted to do and get some friends or family involved. If you can, plan multiple things far ahead, so you can build the anticipation (which can help you enjoy it even more).\n\nAbundance is the enemy of appreciation, \n\nIt may not seem like it some days, but time is even more limited than money. If that's the case for you, you can take the money you already have and buy more time in a couple different ways. For example, our own Adam Pash found that he was much happier after hiring a house cleaner. It freed up his time and he didn't have to argue about cleanliness with his wife. Imagine what you could do with the amount time you spend cleaning now \n\nas you make more money, avoid spending more money. This is called ""lifestyle inflation"", and it can make it seem like you never got a raise to begin with. Spending more money on the things you used to spend less on won't make you any happier. Remember the things that made you happy before your bump in earnings and tell yourself that it doesn't have to change.\n\nhappiness is not a place you reach and rest at. Instead, imagine it like a garden, as it takes constant upkeep and care. As soon as you stop watering and pulling weeds, it can go away. So while it may be true that money can't make you perpetually happy, it can certainly be a quick watering that your plants so desperately need every now and again.\n  "

"Travel","Maldives","http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/worlds-best-honeymoon-destinations-for-2014#!4-maldives\n\nThe islands of the Maldives are quintessential honeymoon destinations with deserted beaches that vie for the title “most romantic spot in the world.” This archipelago of dozens of atolls and more than 1,100 coral islands span 35,000 square feet of the Indian Ocean and is located about 500 miles southwest of Sri Lanka. The Maldives are truly one of the last unspoiled island getaways in the world. \n\nIt’s hard to get there—get ready for a long-haul flight from the United States plus either a seaplane or boat transfer from the international airport—but the effort is rewarded with picture-perfect sunsets, wide beaches, and some of the best diving and snorkeling in the world. This is the place to interact with whale sharks, manta rays, reef sharks, sea turtles, and an array of colorful fish and sea creatures. Resorts are confined to their own islands so you won’t flit from place to place after you arrive. Almost all of the resorts are firmly in the “luxury” category. This is the place to book a beach villa or overwater bungalow.\n\nWhere to Stay: Every island resort is unique so you are bound to find one that fits your vacation style. Consider Per Aquum’s Huvafen Fushi with its underwater spa on the North Male Atoll or Niyama on Dhaalu Atoll. Other popular resorts include Taj Exotica Maldives known for the best cuisine in the South Male Atoll, Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru (North Male Atoll), and Angsana Valavaru (Dhaalu Atoll).\n\nPerfect for Couples Who: Love deserted island escapes. Spend your time lazing on the beach, swimming, snorkeling, diving, and enjoying Maldivian sunrises and sunsets.\n\nPhoto from Guardian article on the Maldives: http://goo.gl/jM4XQK"
"Travel","Belize","http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/worlds-best-honeymoon-destinations-for-2014#!7-belize\n\nLocated in Central America, Belize is an incredibly compelling honeymoon destination for three simple reasons: its close proximity to the United States (a two-hour flight from Miami), its weather (around 84 degrees daily year-round), and the 190-mile-long Belize Barrier Reef. The reef is easily accessible along the coast and is wildly popular for snorkeling and scuba trips, fishing excursions, and romantic sunset cruises. \n\nThe country is hemmed in by the Caribbean Sea on the east, Guatemala to the west, and Mexico in the north. In addition to the Belize Barrier Reef, the country is gifted with pristine beaches, jungle and rainforests, and ruins dating back to the Mayan period. Belize attracts a variety of honeymooners, from nature-lovers to history buffs to diving fanatics to those who simply prefer to sit on the beach at their resort with drink in hand.\n\nWhere to Stay: If water adventures aren’t your thing but you’d still love to honeymoon in Belize, head to Ka’ana Resort in the western part of the country. This inland boutique resort is located in a valley in the Maya Mountains in the Cayo District. Luxurious 1,250-square-foot, one-bedroom private pool villas offer the best of indoor/outdoor living and are ideal for romantic getaways. From the resort, you can enjoy day trips to the Tapir Mountain Nature Reserve; Maya ruins like Tikal, Zunantunichm, and Caracol; Barton Creek Cave for kayaking; horseback riding along the bank of the Mopan River; or go jaguar tracking or bird-watching with expert naturalists and guides.\n\nPerfect for Couples Who: Want an authentic and luxurious but eco-friendly experience that blends the country’s culture with outdoor activities like zip-lining and cave tubing."

Located about 300 km from Delhi and just past Mussoorie, this quaint cantonment town is cleaner, quieter, and relatively untouched compared to its more famous neighbour. For those who feel the compulsion to sightsee, there are two churches in the area—St. Paul's and Kellogg Memorial—aside from which, your itinerary is wide open. There aren't too many places to stay (which keeps the crowds in check), and you'll have to book well in advance."

交通教學, 新手懶人包系列, 給新手的系列\n  \n\n\n\n\n日本從2014年4月1日消費稅從5%增加為8%，車資也都有漲價。不過東京兩個地鐵系統的一日券沒有漲價歐。另外，這兩家公司反其道而行，從2014年4月22日開始發售了「Tokyo Subway Ticket」，可以使用東京metro和都營全部十三條地鐵，一日券由原來的1000yen降價到800yen，還有二日券及三日券，兩日券一天平均只要600yen，三日券一天平均只要500yen，真是太划算了！因此，這個票券真的是東京走透透的省錢首選。一上地鐵基本車資就是170yen（用IC卡的話是165yen），因此，只要做三趟地鐵馬上回本！這篇來單獨整理一下。\n\n中文官網的說明\n圖及新聞來源\n\n2015.1.21：確定了這個票券不只機場有販賣，在東京的Bic Camera也可以憑護照購買。因此，無法在機場買的朋友也沒關係！（東京市內的Bic Camera。包括BIC CAMERA有樂町店、BICQLO BIC CAMERA新宿東口店、BIC CAMERA赤坂見附站店、BIC CAMERA池袋總店、BIC CAMERA澀谷東口店、BIC CAMERA澀谷八公口店、BIC CAMERA新宿東口店、BIC CAMERA新宿西口店及Sofmap秋葉原總店）\n\n2014.7.13：好消息！六個交通會社大合作（包括了京成電鐵、京濱急行電鐵、東京空港交通、京成巴士株式会社、東京都交通局、東京地下鐵），成田機場和羽田機場到東京的許多交通方式現在也將和這張「Tokyo Subway Ticket」推出優惠套票，大家有福了！文末更新有哪些交通套票可以買，還有划算與否。\n\n先來個總表：\nA.兩系統地鐵「Tokyo Subway Ticket」，一日券 800yen、二日券 1200yen，三日券1500yen。（成田羽田機場皆有販售，東京市內的Bic Camera也有得買）\nB.Keisei Skyliner ＆ Tokyo Subway Ticket ：京成電鐵和地鐵券聯票（成田）\nC.WELCOME！Tokyo Subway Ticket：京急電鐵和地鐵券聯票（羽田）\nD.Limousine & Subway Pass ：利木津巴士和地鐵券聯票（成田羽田皆有）\nE.東京シャトル ＆ サブウェイパス：東京Shuttle和地鐵券聯票（成田）\n\n新聞來源\n\n\n \n東京628間旅館比價                                                                京都371間旅館比價 \n\n\n\n\n在不可不知的東京優惠交通票卷整理及重要地鐵站攻略中提到過，東京metro地鐵兩日券（Tokyo Metro OPEN TICKET）是之前我認為在東京一天交通費最終極的省錢方法，一天只花490yen走透透。這是成田/羽田機場限定發售，也是對觀光客的優惠。一上地鐵基本車資就是170yen（用IC卡的話是165yen），因此，只要做三趟地鐵馬上回本！不過這個票券只能使用東京metro的九條地鐵，無法使用另外四條都營的地鐵。\n\n\nA.Tokyo  Subway  Ticket(東京metro地鐵一日/兩日/三日券)，1DAY 800yen、2DAY 1200yen、3DAY 1500yen。\n現在新出的這張「Tokyo Subway Ticket」，有分一日到三日券，一日的平均價錢是800yen，600yen，500yen。原本正常的兩個地鐵都可以用的一日券是1000yen，所以可說是優惠不少。但地鐵一日卷當然也要看每個人的行程和旅館，自己決定哪個好用。也許你旅館在山手線上，那你需要的是JR一日卷。\n\n這個套票是成田/羽田機場/Bic Camera限定發售，是對訪日外國旅客的優惠，購買時需出示護照等以便確認旅客身分。根據網友的回報，我想應該就是在原本賣東京metro兩日券的地方賣。可是，聽說沒有標示，要用問的@@ （背包有朋友說，現在多了一個A4大小的紙，所以可以用指的）\n\n票價：一日券大人800yen、兒童400yen，兩日券大人：1200yen、兒童600yen，三日券大人：1500yen、兒童750yen\n有效期限：車票背面記載的有效期的前1日到3日（目前看到是壓一年以後的日期）。\n\n有效區間：\n東京Metro地鐵全線，包含九條地鐵（銀座線 、副都心線、千代田線 、日比谷線 、丸之內線 、有樂町線 、半藏門線 、東西線 、南北線）\n都營地下鐵全線，包含四條地鐵（包括淺草線、三田線、新宿線、大江戶線）\n\n購買限制：此票是從海外來東京的旅客使用的車票。購票時請出示機票或護照。（但事實上網友買時好像沒有看護照ＸＤ）沒有限制一個人可以購買的張數，不過我之前買東京metro兩日券有預過賣光的情形。\n\n注意事項：東京Metro地鐵不是24小時運行，車票名中的“一日”是指當天始發車至末班車的時間。車票名中的“兩日”是指連續2日內，各日始發車至末班車的時間，不是指48小時。兩日券和三日券只能連續兩天或三天使用。\n\n售票地點：成田機場，羽田機場，東京市內的Bic Camera。包括BIC CAMERA有樂町店、BICQLO BIC CAMERA新宿東口店、BIC CAMERA赤坂見附站店、BIC CAMERA池袋總店、BIC CAMERA澀谷東口店、BIC CAMERA澀谷八公口店、BIC CAMERA新宿東口店、BIC CAMERA新宿西口店及Sofmap秋葉原總店\n\n機場詳細發售點及營業時間如下：\n\n成田機場\n\n\n成田機場第1候機樓1樓大廳（到達）的“巴士賣票櫃台”，服務時間7:00～22:00（請注意，是在南翼，不是北翼）\n成田機場第2候機樓1層大廳（到達）的“京成巴士賣票櫃台”，服務時間7:00～21:00\n\n\n第一航廈就在機場1F一出關的地方對面，就是賣利木津巴士/京成巴士那個櫃台，櫃台有一個小小的Tokyo Subway Ticket看板在桌上。找不到請直接詢問有無賣Tokyo Subway  Ticket。僅能用日幣購買，無法刷卡。\n\n\n羽田機場發售地點：\n国際線ターミナル 2Ｆ 乗車券カウンター(賣巴士票的櫃台)，服務時間5:00～23:00 （就在一出關前方，桌上有一個小牌子，但這個櫃台常常大排長龍）\n国際線ターミナル 2Ｆ 観光情報センター（チケットセンター），服務時間5:30～23:00\n\n\n東京メトロ｜電車・駅のご利用案内｜全路線から検索 via kwout\n東京メトロ（Tokyo Metro）是東京的兩個地鐵系統之一，包含九條地鐵（銀座線 、副都心線、千代田線 、日比谷線 、丸之內線 、有樂町線 、半藏門線 、東西線 、南北線），一般來說已涵蓋絕大部份的重要景點，且比都營線的站密集多了。\n\n2.重要站\n銀座線:  銀座/表參道/新橋/日本橋/末廣町（即秋葉原）/澀谷（轉東急東橫線去橫濱 轉京王井之頭線去吉祥寺）/上野/ 淺草\n\n日比谷線: 中目黑/惠比壽/六本木/神谷町（東京鐵塔）/銀座/築地/人形町/秋葉原/上野\n\n丸之內線:

東京都交通局 via kwout\n\n東京都營系統的四條地下鐵路線（包括淺草線、三田線、新宿線、大江戶線）。請注意，都營巴士、都電荒川線和日暮里・舎人線等其他都營的服務是不能坐的歐。另外，山手線是JR，百合海鷗號是其他系統的私鐵，都不能坐歐！\n\n*請務必要拿著地圖排行程！這張地鐵圖很清楚：中文的兩地鐵合成圖PDF檔 。\n\n如果要用兩個地鐵系統各自的一日卷，你需要這兩張：都營地鐵為主的圖，粗體的是都營。東京Metro為主的圖，粗體的是東京Metro。此外，這三張圖也都有將JR的山手線和中央線畫進去。\n\n\n\nB.Keisei Skyliner ＆ Tokyo Subway Ticket ：京成電鐵和地鐵券聯票（成田）\n\n京成Skyliner也和地鐵有了套票。我覺得有了這個套票之後，加上NEX的優惠票不能只選去程或回程（將會變成只有來回票），京成Skyliner的這個套票會變成大家比較好的選擇歐。單程票根據官網，應該是可用在回程的。\n\n官網中文說明\n\n票價如下（小朋友都是半價）：\n\n\n1、Skyliner單程＋東京地鐵一日券　2800yen（節省470yen）\n2、Skyliner單程＋東京地鐵二日券　3200yen（節省470yen）\n3、Skyliner單程＋東京地鐵三日券　3500yen（節省470yen）\n\nSkyliner 單程原價2470yen，東京地鐵一日券到三日券各自是800，1200，1500yen，所以扣掉之後等於是用2000yen買到，節省470yen。請注意，官網的圖是寫省670，1270，1970yen，但這是用兩系統地鐵一日券原價是1000yen來計算，但我們外國人本來就可以買比較便宜的優惠券，所以其實沒有多省這麼多啦。\n\n\n4、Skyliner來回＋東京地鐵一日券　4700yen（節省1040yen）\n5、Skyliner來回＋東京地鐵二日券   5100yen（節省1040yen）\n6、Skyliner來回＋東京地鐵三日券   5400yen（節省1040yen）\n\n來回票的話，各自是再多1900yen買到，所以等於是回程多省了570yen，總共省了1040yen。由於目前已經沒有Suica-NEX套票了，NEX進東京只剩去程有優惠1500yen，但來回還是要花約4500yen，等於一趟是2250yen，如此Skyliner的優惠等於是一趟1950yen，大家可以參考一下歐。\n\n售票地點：成田機場，請到京成線成田機場第一航廈，第二航廈站的B1 SKYLINER售票處。發售時間是7AM to 10:30PM。\n\n有效期限：【SKYLINER】自發行日起6個月內有效。Skyliner的單程車票上行（成田機場⇒上野方面）及下行（上野⇒成田機場方面）皆可使用。\n【東京地鐵】自發行日起6個月內的任意一日，或任意連續二日內有效。\n\n\n注意事項：\n1.此票是從海外來東京的旅客使用的車票。購票時請出示機票或護照。每人限購一套。\n2.Skyliner全部皆為對號座位。購入此乘車券後，請務必至京成上野、日暮里、第2航廈、第1航廈的Skyliner售票處，指定欲搭乘之列車座位，並持劃位後的liner券乘車。\n\nC.WELCOME！Tokyo Subway Ticket：京急電鐵和地鐵券聯票（羽田）\n\n内容:京急線羽田機場國際線航廈站～泉岳寺站單程車票（只限去程）  與  Tokyo Subway Ticket 套票\n成人：12歲以上  兒童：6歲～12歲以下半價\nＷＥＬＣＯＭＥ！Tokyo Subway 1-Day Ticket 大人１,２００円 （省10yen）\nＷＥＬＣＯＭＥ！Tokyo Subway 2-Day Ticket 大人１,６００円  （省10yen）\nＷＥＬＣＯＭＥ！Tokyo Subway 3-Day Ticket 大人１,９００円 （省10yen）\n\n本來京急只有和都營地鐵一日兩日券有套票，之前票價成人800日圓，兒童400日圓  (兩日卷的話: 成人1200日圓，兒童600日圓)  ，但有限制售票日當天有效 (兩日卷的話: 兩日內有效)，所以不是這麼好用。現在增加了這個套票真是贊啊，不需要一定要當日啟用地鐵券。但很可惜並沒有省多少錢（只省10yen是怎樣），原本和都營的套票可以省100yen 或 200yen。\n\n售票地點：京急線羽田機場國際線航廈站二樓京急旅客服務中心\n\n購買限制：此票是從海外來東京的旅客使用的車票。購票時請出示機票或護照。每人限購一套。\n\n \n\nD.Limousine & Subway Pass ：利木津巴士和地鐵券聯票（成田羽田皆有）\n\n利木津巴士也推出了加上東京metro地鐵一日或兩日券的套票。比NEX單程優待票好的地方是，只買單程的利木津可以用在回程，對於習慣行李變多坐利木津的我非常的適用。另外也可以買兩張＋兩日券，兩人成行的話我可以將兩張利木津都用在回程，也是很方便。（以下是舊的圖）\n\n\n\n價目表（小兒是半價）\nリムジンバス成田路線片道＋Tokyo Subway 1-Day Ticket 大人３,４００円 （省500yen）\nリムジンバス成田路線往復＋Tokyo Subway 2-Day Ticket 大人５,７００円 （省1700yen）\nリムジンバス成田路線往復＋Tokyo Subway 3-Day Ticket 大人６,０００円 （省1700yen）\nリムジンバス羽田路線片道＋Tokyo Subway 1-Day Ticket 大人１,８００円 （省200yen）\nリムジンバス羽田路線往復＋Tokyo Subway 2-Day Ticket 大人３,２００円 （省400yen）\nリムジンバス羽田路線往復＋Tokyo Subway 3-Day Ticket 大人３,５００円 （省400yen）\n\n成田的利木津巴士單程原價3100yen，如果買來回票的話，等於是單趟利木津巴士便宜到2250yen，滿優惠的。羽田機到新宿的利木津巴士原價要1200yen，省得就比較少了。另外注意：要加價的利木津深夜巴士、淩晨巴士不適用歐。\n\n售票地點：利木津巴士的販賣處，包括成田機場1F，新宿西口，TCAT 東京城市航空總站的巴士售票處（東京シティ・エアターミナル），羽田機場，若是回程才用，不用急著在機場買。\n\nE.東京シャトル ＆ サブウェイパス：東京Shuttle和地鐵券聯票（成田）\n寫得好累，這個我沒研究過，下次再補XD\n\n（１） 概要\n東京シャトル乗車券(片道)と Tokyo Subway Ticket の１日券がセットになった乗車券\n（２）発売金額\n大人１,７００円

"Travel","Suikerbossie Guest Farm","Where	90km from Ceres (& 30km on rough dirt road from Citrusdal)\nGPS co-ords	S 32°40'05''  E 19°15'19''\nSuikerbossie has evolved in massive leaps and bounds since the Captain Getaway and his trusty hound, the Budget Brak, first visited a few years ago. What started out as a rough and ready experience is now the ‘safari getaway’ of the Koue Bokkeveld. \n\nA 1700ha farm pressed deep into this wild and craggy region, Suikerbossie is envied among locals for its gushing rock pools and waterfalls. Complementing the pristine setting are 18 camp sites, all virtually in the water and two of them equipped.  \n\nYou have to experience it firsthand, but to give you a small taste… \n\nWaterfall Camp (sleeps 12 in six double beds, plus 10 in own tent) is the most secluded – a spacious abode set above a waterfall and crystal pools. It's fitted with shutter windows, a thick timber counter and benches, a fridge, gas stove, oil and solar lighting and enough cutlery, plates, pots and tin mugs for a posse of campers who like their wild in style. Outside, there are hot showers, ablutions with two loo's and a scullery area. \n\nMoving along to the main river, Ghoeboontjie Camp (sleep 4, plus 4 in own tent) is more rustic. In this case a caravan (or, if the group is larger, your own tent) provides a bed for the weekend, decked out in front with a pebble-fringed patio and a patch of green lawn under a shady wild almond tree. Like Waterfall, the camp has everything you could wish for in a rustic African safari, including an expanse of open water stocked with yellow fish. \n\nFairly close by are Kuil Camp (sleeps 12 and more), Waterfront (2-6), Bo River (10) and the Bo Tarzaan Swing (6-8) camps. All four are grassed, equipped with thatch gazebos for shade, and have access to fridges. You'll also find a Tarzan swing over the river - the experience just wouldn't be the same without it. \n\nA little further along, River Camp is a private campsite spread on lush lawns, under an enormous Cape pine tree.\n\nAll the camps have a tap for drinking water, a braai area, a large and centrally positioned ablution block and of course, the nearby river. \n\nApart from unique infrastructure and gushing water, Suikerbossie offers good odds on spotting duiker, klipspringer, baboon, and maybe even a leopard. There are several walking trails in the area, among them a donkey trail that was used in the old days to transport wheat down the mountain. A super new 4x4 route has now been opened and there are tubes and boats for hire."

Ngày 2/9, ban ngày em có thể đi shopping tại Pratunam, Plantinum, MBK và Siam Paragon. Buối tối lượn China town xong nếu máu có thể ghé qua Nana hoặc Soi Cowboy chơi, nhiều cái hay lắm á. VN không có đ.   ​Bạn ơi,\nNếu bạn quyết định đi Pattaya sáng 3/9, thì tôi sẽ tư vấn cho:\n- Bắt xe buýt tại Ekamai, hay đi Taxi\n- Bắt xe Song Theaw tại bến xe Pattaya, 150-200B (hay đi xe ST chung, 30B một người) về KS\n- Đề nghị KS ở Pattaya sát bải biển cho bạn (và Mẹ bạn, còn ai nữa không, bao nhiêu người?), khoảng 600.000đ một đêm, bạn tự Book qua Agoda, tương đối tốt, 3 *, sát Beach Road, bải biển chính, 5 phút đi bộ sang TTTM, 10 phút đến Walking Street, băng sang đường là đến bải biển, thuê ghế nằm khoảng 20B, dừa tươi 40B\n- Các TTTM shopping gần KS, Royal Garden, Central Festival, Mike Department, BigC, ..\n- Chỗ ăn đồ Thái rất ngon và rẻ (Chợ ở Pattaya Central Road, chủ yếu là đồ biển, đi bộ, hay đi xe ST đến, 10B)\n- Chỗ ăn Sushi và đồ Tây ngon & rẻ trong TTTM\n- Ăn sáng + hóng gió trên bải biển (mua thức ăn sáng ở 7/11 sát KS, và băng sang đường ra bải biển ngồi ăn sáng, ..), Hay ăn sáng ở LK Empress sát KS, 190B, ngon tuyệt như trong KS 5 *\n- Ăn trưa ở quán Beer Bar trên biển (ngon, rẻ và phong cảnh tuyệt vời)\n- Masage chân ở Soi Buakhao, 100B một giờ (Tôi sẽ cho bạn địa chỉ massage chân rất tuyệt và rẻ ở Pratunam nếu cần, cũng 100B một giờ, lần nào sang tôi cũng massage chân 2-3 lần, đi Platinum mỏi chân thì vào đây)\n- Xe Taxi từ Pattaya đi Don Muang (xe buýt Bell Travel không còn đi DM nữa, họ chỉ đi Suvarnabhumi thôi)\n- Đi quán Bar ở Walking Street (nếu bạn đi với Mẹ thì không nên!)\nBạn quyết định và báo cho tôi biết nhé.\n(có thể đầu tháng 8 tôi sẽ sang chơi ở Pattaya+Bangkok hay KUL).a quá. Nếu bạn muốn đi mua sắm các nơi quen thuộc như MBK, Paragon, Discovery, Platinum, CentralWord, Terminal21, .. Bangkok 68 cách trạm MRT Sutthisan ít nhất 1km. Mỗi ngày đi về khá tốn kém và tốn thời gian. Bạn định ở BKK mấy ngày, định đi chơi đâu?\nTheo tôi tốt nhất là ở gần các trạm BTS (hay MRT) quanh trung tâm. Bạn sẽ thấy đi lại rất thuận tiện, Nhất là sau 10g tối, rất khó bắt taxi và tốn kém lắm, nếu ở xa như Bangkok68.\nTốn hơn vài trăm nghìn VN một ngày mà đỡ tốn tiền đi lại cũng vậy, đỡ tốn thời gian quý báu.\nĐề nghị bạn xem các KS sau đây, đều gần BTS, 400-500N VND. Sau khi chọn KS rồi, nếu cần tôi sẽ hướng dẫn thêm.a quá. Nếu bạn muốn đi mua sắm các nơi quen thuộc như MBK, Paragon, Discovery, Platinum, CentralWord, Terminal21, ..

Và đi bộ sang.\nChiều đi BTS về trạm Chitlom, vào Central Chitlom xem, và đi bộ sang BigC. Shopping ở BigC, và đi bộ anh Platinum gần đó. Tối đi bộ sang Baiyoke Sky để ăn Buffet. Nên đến sớm khoảng 4:30, đổi voucher Hotel2Thailand lấy vé buffet và tham quan ở tầng 19. Sau đó lên tầng 77 để xem BKK trên cao và lên luôn tầng 84 (nếu không lầm), tầng quay 360 độ. Sau đó xuống tầng 76-78 để ăn buffet. Ăn thì không ngon lắm nhưng phong cảnh trển cao rất đẹp. Nhất là buối tối. Tối có thể bắt Taxi về hay đi bộ ra BTS.\nCháu có thể đi xem Central World và Paragon, nhưng nơi đây chỉ bán hàng hiệu, khá đắt nếu không có Sale. Nên đi MBK và Platinum hơn.\nKhông nên vào chơ Pratunam làm gì cho mệt người, trừ phi cháu đi buôn, mua hàng chợ về bán."

The magic? Cheap ticket prices. “I don’t have a complete list for this year, yet,” said Seaney “because airlines don’t begin actively managing prices until about three months ahead [for domestic fares]. But I can get you started.”\n\nLISTEN: Rick Seaney has more details.\n\n\nSave Up to 50% on Spring Break\n\nThe week-long U.S. vacation period known as Spring Break generally falls between late February and early April, varying by region and as analyst Rick Seaney notes, “You better believe the airlines know exactly when each and every Spring Break period occurs.” Prices typically rise sharply during these weeks, but there is one way to save:\n\nFly on Tuesday of your Spring Break week, return on Saturday. “By avoiding weekend-to-weekend flights, you can save up to 50 percent or more,” said Seaney.\nYou can begin shopping for Spring Break fares now.\n\nSave Up to 40% on Flights to & from Europe\n\nThere are two magic dates for U.S. departures to cities in Europe – or from Europe to the U.S.\n\nMay 14: Pay 20 to 30 percent less by departing on May 14 instead of May 15.\nAug 23: Pay almost 40 percent less by departing on Aug. 23 instead Aug. 22.\nIn both cases, the dates are right on the cusp of seasonal price changes. Higher, near-peak summer prices kick in on May 15 while Aug. 23 marks the start of the cheaper fall season.\n\nNote: For flights to Asia, you may find similar savings – roughly around the same dates – but you must compare airfare prices to be sure of finding the specific seasonal price break-point.\n\nGeneral Guidelines for Cheapest Summer Fares\n\nIf you can take an early or late summer vacation, you will save money. Examples:\n\nFly up to the first week in June: This is when higher, domestic summer fares begin.\nFly after the third week in August: This is typically when prices drop for fall.\nBut don’t buy tickets just yet.\n\nWhen to Shop\n\nYou can wait until March to shop for  early summer trips.\n\nWhen to buy: Start shopping 3 months before departure, complete purchase by 30 days before.\nWhen to fly: When traveling in the U.S. fly Tuesday, Wednesday or Saturday.\nAgain, for summertime travel in the U.S. there’s no rush. Suggestion: Start perusing all the deals out there – then, start dreaming.\n\nAuthor: Anne McDermott\nUpdated: January 8, 2015\nTravel News\nAirfare Analysis"

Một số quần áo thời trang giá bình dân. Bạn phải chuẩn bị đi bộ khá nhiều. Có điều hòa, không chen lấn nên cũng rất thoải mái. Bên kia đường có 2 TTTM nhỏ cũng có nhiều hàng tương tự).\n- 19:00, đi bộ sang góc đường Phetchaburi và Ratchadami, đối diện Palladium, ăn tối quán cơm gà Hải Nam (gần cầu), hay ăn ở Platinum food center, tầng trên cùng\n- Sau ăn tối tiếp tục shopping ở Platinum hay sang BigC shopping\n(Trong Central World, bán hàng hiệu khá đắt, trang trí sang trọng, nên xem.

Nhiều cửa hàng bán đồ factory, đồ lưu niệm, nhiều nhà hàng, có Calypso cabaret show, show BĐ khoảng 1000b không hay bằng Alcazar ở Patttaya. Hàng hóa và thức ăn đắt hơn. Phong cảnh ban đêm rất đẹp, nên đi cho biết.\n\n19/9\nNgày này mình chưa biết đi đâu, làm gì. Bạn có thể tư vấn giúp mình nơi nào gần khách sạn, dễ đi lại dc không?\nNhững TTTM khác bạn chưa đi là.

"Travel","Staten Island Boat Graveyard (free)","One of the spookiest places in town is the Staten Island Boat Graveyard. Located far from the urban bustle in Rossville, Staten Island, this swampy patch of the Arthur Kill Road waterway is the final resting place for dozens of rusting, decomposing and abandoned boats of all sizes. The rotting ship hulls, protruding from the watery depths, are oddly majestic and beautiful (but also kind of gross; we recommend wearing long pants and sturdy shoes if you go). The gravesite is located off of Arthur Kill Road near Rossville Avenue, about 13 miles by bike or car from the ferry terminal. As of 2013, there's no longer a public path all the way to the water, but you can steal a glimpse of the boats before a padlocked fence gets in your way. It's a truly forgotten corner of the City. "

Lúc nào đi DL chúng tôi đi cả 2 vợ chồng nên không biết các chỗ khác.  Nếu cháu muốn bãi biển thiên nhiên hơn, cháu đi phà ra đảo Koh Larn, cách 30-40 phút, ra đó thuê xe máy đi dạo chung quanh đảo, hoang vu, khá đẹp, như Phú Quốc.\nCó thời gian cháu nên đi dạo dọc theo bãi biển, có đường trải gạch rất khang trang, hay thuê ghế ngồi trên bãi (20b) gió biển mát, rất thoải mái, như resort đắt tiền (nếu ở AA Pattaya, cháu bước vài bước là đến bãi biến rồi)"

So here we go.\n> Uber. It's a super cool app that's basically like the Airbnb of Taxi companies. In the US you get $20 towards your first ride. I've explained the details of how Uber's sign up promotion code works here [ http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=9aUuY&m=3kBvN3ZnXPgaDSJ&b=ks1VgQ1M9mQ.HcCQnoNdGg ]. This is the story of 1) How I've gotten the Uber signup bonus like 100 times. And 2) how to get around the issue of the bonus only working in the US.\n> When you sign up for Uber with my referral code, you get $20 towards Uber and I get $20 towards Uber. So what is stopping you from referring yourself instead of me? Well first thing is that you need to create a first account anyways and might as well use someone's referral code. However, I don't need you to use mine [ http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=9aUuY&m=3kBvN3ZnXPgaDSJ&b=zNkmKOVb8oWNh1xLbQdASA ] (honestly) because I've got a way around it... well, I've got to explain the second thing.\n> Second problem is that each Uber account has to be confirmed by phone number. And not only that, but each phone number only gets one Uber confirmation ever. So don't call your sibling and have them confirm a second account for you because then they will never be able to sign up for Uber themselves. And at this rate the entire world will be using Uber by March. (Kidding... kind of).\n> Same thing actually with your email address. You use email addresses to sign into Uber.\n> So we have two problems:\n>  1.\n> You would need multiple phone numbers.\n>  2.\n> You would need multiple email addresses.\n> Obviously it's easier to get email addresses but I have quickish fixes for both.\n> Here are the fixes\n> Phone number: You need to confirm via text but text apps like “TextMe” do not get/send texts with Uber. Uber just knows it's a fake text number. Trust me, I've tried more than one text app and most don't work. However, I read on Uber's website that google voice numbers can confirm Uber numbers. So it is possible. But I've told people this and they seem to have trouble setting it up, plus I've been doing quite a lot of numbers.\n> So a different solution is “Burner App”. Download the Burner App and create a second phone number to sign up with Uber. Then when you go to get a ride with the Uber app, it will need to confirm the phone number. Burner will get a text and you reply “GO” (all caps?).\n> Bam. A second phone number on one phone.\n> Then for the email address... Gmail allows you to make folders with an email address itself. So myname@gmail.com could be uber.myname@gmail.com. While this doesn't work for everything, it certainly works for signing into Uber.\n> Bam. A second phone number and a second email address. Thus a second Uber sign up. But the best part is that you can refer yourself. Now when your second account gets a $20 ride for free, your first account gets a $20 ride for later. This happens after the ride and not after signing up, btw.\n> Getting around Burner\n> Now I'll introduce problem number two before moving onto some other fun stuff.\n> The next big problem. Burner only gives its first number for free, and then charges $1 for the second. Now this may reveal just how cheap I am, but I'm not paying $1 for a text number I'll use once. But here's the funny thing, Burner needs you to confirm your burner number with a text. So you get one per text number, but the difference here is that burner does take texts from free apps like “TextNow”.\n> If this doesn't make sense to you, then you've got it! Because it's quite odd.\n> I'm now creating new logins (with new emails) to the “TextNow” app to get numbers to confirm my “Burner” app, to confirm my “Uber” app.\n> TextNow → Burner → Uber\n> The confirmation train.\n> Once again. Via creating a new email to get a new login for the TextNow app, I can confirm a new Burner number, to confirm a new Uber account, which can use the same new email I just created for TextNow.\n> And each time I take a ride my first account is getting bonuses as well. May I also note that the Uber drivers get paid in full when you use these credits. Just FYI.\n> Different Currencies\n> Heading to Europe I found another problem- my US bonuses of $20 off the first ride do not work in other countries (verified by Uber.com). So now I had to sign up for Euro bonuses and I've got some details on how that works now.\n> The Uber bonus you get is based on your current location when signing up.\n> This means that while I'm in Poland, if I sign up I get my bonus in Zloty... which won't help me when I arrive in Vienna. For you, if you're heading to Paris, signing up in the US you'll get $20, which won't help you when you land in Paris.\n> There are two ways of doing this.\n> The first way to rack up Euro bonuses is to use a “proxy” in a country that uses the Euro. You can check Uber cities here - http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=9aUuY&m=3kBvN3ZnXPgaDSJ&b=s7ON1gq_ubJDLljXVAJJig -- to not only see what cities have Uber, but to get a quote/estimate for a route in the local currency.\n> Anyways, google “German Proxy” or something like this and find a German vpn to go through, and Uber will think your computer is in Germany and give you a bonus in Euros.\n> Now, there is a plus side and a downside to the European Uber system. The bad news is that the US bonus of $20 is the highest I know of. In Europe they give €10, and in Czech and Poland they gave the equivilent of $10. But the good news is that unlike the US $20 bonus, you can combine them. The US $20 bonus is for your first ride. It doesn't matter if the ride is $10, your credit will be completely used up after that first ride. In Europe two things happen.\n> The first thing that happens is that when you refer someone from a Euro account (or non-US account) the bonus is collected in Europe but also it adds up. So if I refer myself 10 times, then I'll have €100 worth of Uber credit on my first account. And the second thing that happens, is that when I go to use it, it only uses/deducts the cost of the ride from the credit and leaves the remaining balance for you to use later. This of course is closer to common sense, but it's not the way it works in the US.\n> Anyways... Back to collecting in Euros.\n> So the first thing is to keep signing up from a proxy.\n> The second thing is to keep referring from the account created in the proxy.\n> If I create an account here in Europe (whether I'm actually here or via a Proxy), all referrals I collect will be in Euros. Period. And if you referred me from your US account and I took a ride in Europe, despite the fact that my bonus was in Euros, and my ride payment was in Euros, you – the person who referred me – would get a $20 bonus.\n> So what you could do is create a Europe account and then refer yourself in the US. Take a ride under $20 in the US and not only is it free with your sign up credit, but your first account will collect €10. €10 per account that takes a ride.\n> The beauty of this is both that you could get a longer more expensive Uber ride in Europe for free, or you can take many short rides without needing to use your whole bonus on the first ride.\n> My attempts not to get banned\n> I haven't been banned yet, but lately I've been nervous for no reason and have been spreading out my referrals across accounts... which I should probably create a spreadsheet for...\n> Please let me know if other people have gotten in trouble but I've been fine. And I wonder if it's because I sign in from multiple locations on a phone that is completely wifi based. In other words, the only thing Uber could track is each hotel's IP address and I change hotels more often than I change clothes, so I don't see this to be an issue for me. Could be paranoid advise, but maybe use wifi to sign up?\n> Also, a tip for any wifi users.\n> Uber is really bad at detecting your location when you're on wifi. It has told the drivers I'm blocks away from the hotel I'm at. So it's not based on the router, it's based on GPS. So if you use wifi, make sure you set the pick up location to your hotel. (Best advise in this long winded mess). I also then set the destination (and get an estimate), but once I'm in the car, I'm away from wifi and can't check it until I get to the next hotel/destination.\n> Conclusion\n>  *\n> TextNow app → Burner App → Uber = multiple Uber accounts\n>  *\n> Add a word and a dot infront of your gmail address to make a unique email address. Although Uber doesn't need you to confirm your email address, but it's for remembering and logging in later.\n>  *\n> Use a proxy to create accounts in other currencies\n>  *\n> Set your pick up location if you use wifi\n> Ladies, gentlemen. Brothers, sisters. Friends, comrades.\n> It's been a jolly time, and I do hope something in here was helpful.\n> Also, please do check out the widget in the top right. I've added a little navigation bar that has: Guides, Infographics, and Resources.\n> http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=9aUuY&m=3kBvN3ZnXPgaDSJ&b=Pij_bO9piyYL323a4qt9GQ\n> Click the tabs [ http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=9aUuY&m=3kBvN3ZnXPgaDSJ&b=r9Ch16f46MKnN18cCplfbg ] and hopefully you'll see some timeless resources for yourself and to share with others. ;-)\n> Cheers,\n> Drew\n> Drew and Carrie\n> Travelisfree.com, 2601 Oak Drive, Bay City, Texas 77414, USA\n> To unsubscribe or change subscriber options visit:\n> http://www.aweber.com/z/r/?zEysTByMrLSsbIwMnExs7LRGtEysHOycTOyM"

"Travel","Travet Security","Lessons Learned\n\nThese lessons can and do apply to everyone. Crime can happen anywhere, whether it be 6 or 6,000 miles from home. The following are some precautions well worth heeding:\n\nDon’t be a moron. Use common sense. Hindsight is always just that. No use crying over spilt milk as the saying goes. Knowing I had all my important possessions with me, I should of insisted that one of us stay in the car. My pack was too heavy to bring into the store but I should of taken my camera. Take a moment to access your situation regardless of where you are. If everything disappeared how momentous would this be? Assess, assess, assess.\n\nConsistently back up important files to the cloud. This is a great idea in theory but not always easy to do, especially when traveling. Having a good internet connection that’s quick and efficient is difficult to find. I still haven’t figured out a way that’s quick and convenient. If you have any ideas please let me know.\n\nDownload apps that help you find your lost phone. Become familiar with the app Find My Phone and use it. Familiarize yourself with how it works. Does it work anywhere or does it need to be connected to the internet? \n\nRecord your IMEI number of your telephone. All devices have a unique identity number, known as the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number. If your phone is stolen it then can be tracked if it’s being used online so keep a note of it somewhere safe. To find out your number, look behind the battery or dial *#06# into your phone and it will display on screen. Email it to yourself so you know where it is.\n\nKeep a copy of your passport somewhere separate from your belongings. My passport was stolen but my travel companion had a copy with her. That made life easier when I went to the American Embassy in San Jose to replace it.\n\nHave an insurance rider on your important and expensive belongings. Insurance companies are notorious at looking for ways to not pay for losses. Insurance riders are purchased separately from a basic policy and helps provide additional coverage at reasonable costs. Standard policies usually leave little room for modification or customization, beyond choosing deductibles and coverage amounts. Riders help policyholders meet their specific needs. As a photographer I’ve found this coverage to pay for itself time and time again.\n\nBesides these practical lessons there’s some internal one’s as well. Losing this stuff forced me to slow down and take a deeper look at my life. It’s made me realize there’s more important things in life besides “stuff” and seeing the world through a camera lens. Besides, no one was hurt, which is the most important fact of all.\n\nYeah, it’s a bummer, but there’s not a darn thing I can do to change it. So the best thing I can do is to take 5 minutes to mourn and then move on. I’m safe, I’m blessed, and I’m healthy. I’m also damn lucky to be out experiencing and living life to the fullest. With so much to be thankful for, why devote any time dwelling on what can’t be changed?\n"

KS có hồ bơi nhưng nhỏ, mình ở 3 ngày thấy chẳng ai bơi, trước cửa là quán sushi Masa, cứ từ 10am đến 8pm là full người ăn ở trỏng, có cả người đang xếp hàng chờ nữa, thấy cũng kích thích lắm nhưng mình không thử vì không thích sushi cho lắm, mình thấy ăn ở đâu cũng vậy do không biết đánh giá cá tươi thế nào, mù tạc thế nào ... nói chung là chờ một THÁNH SUSHI nào đó ăn thử rồi cho review . Thái độ phục vụ của nhân viên KS thì bth, không có gì để than phiền. Mình để ý thấy KS có cả dịch vụ gửi đồ dành cho những người có chuyến bay trễ để check out đi chơi rồi về lấy đồ ra sân bay sau. Và đó là Siam Swana. \n\n\n\nCheck in Ks tắm rửa xong mình đi thẳng vào plan của mình đó thử quán ăn đc một nhà nghiên cứu ẩm thực local bangkok bình chọn là best restaurant năm 2013 (gọi là restaurant thôi chứ nó là quán ăn gia đình bth thôi) - quán tên là P’Aor (ร้านพี่อ้อ), từ KS mình ra đó khoảng 1km, từ Bangkok city hotel đi ra đó khoảng 5-600 m gì đó.

Vào Terminal 21 thì thấy hơi thất vọng, không như mình nghĩ (lần đầu tiên zô, lần trước mình đi hình như nó đang sửa lại) - Khu này nó chia tầng ra, mỗi tầng có một concept khác nhau, chủ đề là thủ đô của các nước. Tuy nhiên mình thấy trang trí vẫn chưa đc nổi bật lắm. Cái bụng đói dẫn mình lên foodcourt tầng 5 , nhưng vì đang đói quá mà phải nhìn hằng hà xa số món ăn trên tầng 5 mình không thể lựa chọn đc và cuối cùng quyết định xuống tầng 4 (tầng 5 foodcourt, tầng 4 là nhà hàng) ăn một quán thuộc chuỗi nhà hàng khá kinh điển của Thái Lan - BBQ Plaza - biểu tựong của quán là một con rồng mập lùn màu xanh lá cây. Quán có phong cách cũng lạ lắm, trên là nướng, xung quang là nước để nhúng lẩu, nước chấm rất ngon (rất giống nước chấm của quán lẩu Soa Soa trên đường Phạm Ngọc Thạch - nhưng theo mình thấy là ngon hơn nhiều) mình kêu 4 khay thịt và một ít rau để nhúng - 2 người hết tầm 400 baht, nói chung cũng đáng thử.\n\nĂn xong dạo dạo Terminal 21 đc một xíu thì đóng cửa, đành ra về. Lúc bấy giờ chả biết đi đâu do các khu chơi khuya mình đã thử qua những lần trước hết rồi (Nana, Patpong, Soi Cowboi, Khao San)chỉ còn biết ra chợ trời Siam Square để shopping quần áo lặt vặt, quần áo ở đây mình thấy đa số là hàng tuyển lựa từ Chatuchak và Platinum (và các chợ sỉ khác), đồ đẹp và cũng không mắc hơn chợ sỉ là bao nhiêu nếu bạn vào chợ sỉ để mua lẻ. Mà hình như khu chợ trời này đã bị giới hạn giờ hoạt động và khu vực hoạt động từ khi khu phức hợp mua sắm Siam Square One đưa vào hoạt động , buồn thiệt, mình rất là thích mua đồ ở đây  Tình hình là mới đi về nên cũng muốn viết vài dòng làm kỷ niệm, tiện thể chia sẽ thông tin cho các bạn sắp đi mà còn lăn tăn nhiều vấn đề.

KS có hồ bơi nhưng nhỏ, mình ở 3 ngày thấy chẳng ai bơi, trước cửa là quán sushi Masa, cứ từ 10am đến 8pm là full người ăn ở trỏng, có cả người đang xếp hàng chờ nữa, thấy cũng kích thích lắm nhưng mình không thử vì không thích sushi cho lắm, mình thấy ăn ở đâu cũng vậy do không biết đánh giá cá tươi thế nào, mù tạc thế nào ... nói chung là chờ một THÁNH SUSHI nào đó ăn thử rồi cho review . Thái độ phục vụ của nhân viên KS thì bth, không có gì để than phiền. Mình để ý thấy KS có cả dịch vụ gửi đồ dành cho những người có chuyến bay trễ để check out đi chơi rồi về lấy đồ ra sân bay sau. Và đó là Siam Swana. \n\n\n\nCheck in Ks tắm rửa xong mình đi thẳng vào plan của mình đó thử quán ăn đc một nhà nghiên cứu ẩm thực local bangkok bình chọn là best restaurant năm 2013 (gọi là restaurant thôi chứ nó là quán ăn gia đình bth thôi) - quán tên là P’Aor (ร้านพี่อ้อ), từ KS mình ra đó khoảng 1km, từ Bangkok city hotel đi ra đó khoảng 5-600 m gì đó. Ai muốn biết quán này nó bán gì và nó ra thế nào thì xem thử review của bác Mark Wiens - một nhà nghiên cứu ẩm thực Châu Á trong link này nhé P’Aor \nhttp://www.eatingthaifood.com/2014/0...taurants-2013/\nTrong top 10 list này thì mình thử đc 2 món , đó là món số 1 P'aor và món số 2 - Cơm cà ry Jake Puey. Còn ai muốn biết đường đi đến đây thì liên lạc mình nhé. Lưu ý các quán này có thời gian hoạt động hết nhé, thường hay nghỉ vào thứ 2, mọi người plan kỹ trước khi đi  - Ah, ăn ở P'aor hết khoảng 400 baht nhé - mình kêu đến 4 món - no cành hông nhưng phải thử vì chưa biết khi nào mới có thể quay lại  \n\n\n\nĂn xong mình phóng ngay đi chợ Chatuchak ở BTS Mochit - bạn nào đi lần đầu tiên thì đừng sợ lạc đường , hãy làm theo như sau :\n- Đến BTS Mochit (cái này ai cũng biết )- xem bảng hướng dẫn các cổng EXIT (cái này BTS hay MRT ở nước nào cũng có, nó sẽ hướng dẫn Exit 1 ra đâu, exit 2 ra đâu) cứ theo đúng số cổng EXit nào ra Chatuchak thì đi ra Exit đó.\n- Khi đã xác định đc exit rồi thì cứ hòa theo dòng người (đặc biệt là mấy em gái xinh tương xách cái vali vải bự bự là đích thị đi chatuchak), vào đc đến cổng chợ (Chatuchak có 3 hay 4 cổng gì đấy- tham khảo bản đồ nhé) rồi thì nhìn lên bên trên của mấy cái sạp để xác định coi nó là Section bao nhiêu , Soi bao nhiêu để mà lên kế hoạch đi Chatuchak nhé  mình đi 2 lần rồi nhưng chưa lần nào đi được hết .... 1/3 cái chợ \n\n* Lời khuyên chân thành là thích đồ lưu niệm gì cứ mua, thích món ăn vặt gì cứ ăn, còn mua QUẦN ÁO thì suy nghĩ cho thật kĩ nhé nhé nhé  tất cả quần áo mà mình mua trong 2 lần ghé thăm chợ đều biến thành quà tặng vì không mặc đc (mặc xấu hoặc ko vừa) - chắc tại mình không phải chuyên gia shopping quần áo \n\nXong trận lê lết lầy lội ở Chatuchak thì mình quay về KS để thanh trần cơ thể rồi thay đồ đẹp đi Terminal 21 ăn foodcourt cho nó lành mạnh (lúc bấy giờ là gần 8h ràu). Vào Terminal 21 thì thấy hơi thất vọng, không như mình nghĩ (lần đầu tiên zô, lần trước mình đi hình như nó đang sửa lại) - Khu này nó chia tầng ra, mỗi tầng có một concept khác nhau, chủ đề là thủ đô của các nước. Tuy nhiên mình thấy trang trí vẫn chưa đc nổi bật lắm. Cái bụng đói dẫn mình lên foodcourt tầng 5 , nhưng vì đang đói quá mà phải nhìn hằng hà xa số món ăn trên tầng 5 mình không thể lựa chọn đc và cuối cùng quyết định xuống tầng 4 (tầng 5 foodcourt, tầng 4 là nhà hàng) ăn một quán thuộc chuỗi nhà hàng khá kinh điển của Thái Lan - BBQ Plaza - biểu tựong của quán là một con rồng mập lùn màu xanh lá cây. Quán có phong cách cũng lạ lắm, trên là nướng, xung quang là nước để nhúng lẩu, nước chấm rất ngon (rất giống nước chấm của quán lẩu Soa Soa trên đường Phạm Ngọc Thạch - nhưng theo mình thấy là ngon hơn nhiều) mình kêu 4 khay thịt và một ít rau để nhúng - 2 người hết tầm 400 baht, nói chung cũng đáng thử.\n\nĂn xong dạo dạo Terminal 21 đc một xíu thì đóng cửa, đành ra về. Lúc bấy giờ chả biết đi đâu do các khu chơi khuya mình đã thử qua những lần trước hết rồi (Nana, Patpong, Soi Cowboi, Khao San)chỉ còn biết ra chợ trời Siam Square để shopping quần áo lặt vặt, quần áo ở đây mình thấy đa số là hàng tuyển lựa từ Chatuchak và Platinum (và các chợ sỉ khác), đồ đẹp và cũng không mắc hơn chợ sỉ là bao nhiêu nếu bạn vào chợ sỉ để mua lẻ. Mà hình như khu chợ trời này đã bị giới hạn giờ hoạt động và khu vực hoạt động từ khi khu phức hợp mua sắm Siam Square One đưa vào hoạt động , buồn thiệt, mình rất là thích mua đồ ở đây \n\n\n\nKết thúc ngày 1 bằng chai nước lựu ngay dưới chân cầu thang BTS national stadium \n\nDay 2-\n\nDay 2 của mình cũng bth không có gì đặc biệt, chủ yếu là mua sắm đồ hiệu trong các mall lớn\n\nMình đi nguyên dọc Central World, Siam paragon , siam center và Siam Discoveries,\nCó một lời khuyên chân thành là bạn nên plan kỹ khi đi mấy cái mall này vì thực sự nó rất bự và nhiều khu vực không đáng mất thời gian để đi lòng vòng trong đó. Ví dụ như tòa nhà central world bao gồm khu mua sắm của central world , Isetan, Zen và một cái nữa B2k hay B2s gì đó, mình thấy đi hết khu mua sắm của Central world là đc rùi, mấy bạn có thể down cái app trên google play store, gõ central world là nó ra cái app có nguyên cái directory, cái này nè :\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/d...ralworld&hl=en\n\nXem chỗ nào mình cần đi thì thu xếp đi cho gọn nhé \nCác brand đang sale mà mình để ý thấy gồm có : H&M, Uniqlo, Giordano, GAP, Topshop Topman..... blah blah cũng nhiều nhưng mà mình chán shopping đồ hiệu ở nước ngoài rồi vì ở VN cũng đã có gần hết các hiệu này (Topshop Topman cũng đang sale dưới bitexconè). Ăn sáng trưa (brunch) của ngày 2 là ăn ở foodcourt Central World, gọi là Central Food Hall ở tầng 7, đồ ăn tạm được, đc cái rất rẻ, 50 baht ăn no cành - foodcourt VN không có vụ này bao giờ \n\nChiều thì mình PLAN là đi Yaowarat - tàu khựa town để khám phá vui chơi và thưởng thức ẩm thực nhưng dường như thế giới như sụp đổ khi trời chiều 5h mà nó tối sầm , thế là chuyện gì đến cũng đến, giông bão kéo đến mưa gió ầm ầm. Chờ đến 6h vẫn chưa hết mưa mình quyết định nhổ neo luôn, xách balo lên và xuất phát đến Yaowarat, ai đi bộ giống mình thì đi BTS đến chỗ cắt MRT gần nhất rồi chuyển sang MRT đi đến ga cuối Hua Lam Phong , ra exit nào tiện nhất(nhớ tham khảo bản đồ ở trạm MRT trước khi exit) rồi tra google map để hoặc map giấy cũng đc để đi đến Yaowarat nhé. \n\nHôm đó giông tố quá nên mình không thể xài google map hay map giấy đc, thành ra mình đi đến đâu cũng kiếm người hỏi đường, cứ nay ngã 3 ngã 4 là kiếm người hỏi. Thế là rút ra đc kinh nghiệm cũng hay : mình hỏi người ta là yaowarat (dao qua rát) thì người ta ú ớ không hiẻu, may mà có cô kia nhanh trí nói "" ah dao qua LÁT not dao qua RÁT"" vậy là cứ tiếp tục đi tip mà khi nào bí đường thì cứ đọc thần chú ""dao qua lát dao qua lát"" là sẽ đến nơi ngay thdc yaowarat, trời mưa không thể làm át đi không khí ăn chơi ở khu ẩm thực nổi tiếng này, thế là cứ lao vào mà ăn mà chơi thôi :\nKhu này có thịt nướng, xúc xích nướng, vịt quay, hủ tiếu thái (boat noodle), nui thái, pad thái, mì tàu, nước quýt nước lựu, măng cụt, sầu riêng, xôi xoài, hạt dẻ, búa lua xua nhưng cái đăc biệt nhất là quán hải sản T&K hay các thánh du lịch bangkok còn gọi là ""hải sản bên xanh bên đỏ"", có nghĩa là có 2 quán, 1 quán phục vụ mặc áo xanh lá cây, bên còn lai mặc áo đỏ, không cần biết bên nào nhái bên nào nhưng cứ thấy bên nào đông bu zô bên đó - và hình như là đội xanh lúc nào cũng là đội chiến thắng  . Vào ăn ca ri cua với cà ri tôm siêu rẻ, kêu thêm dĩa chứng triên hàu và 2 lon pepsi hai người hết có tầm 500 baht, giá này chỉ bằng giá tiền của một dĩa ca ri cua ở VN (mình nghĩ vậy).  đi tếp trên đường Yaowarat cho đến khi gặp ngã 4 Mangkon và Yaowarat thì quẹo phải rồi đi tiếp đến khi gặp quán cơm cà ry Jake Puey, á quân trong top 10 bangkok restaurant - quán này mở cửa 4h chiều đến tầm 8 9 giờ tói, nghỉ thứ 2, ai đi thì đi sớm để còn đủ các món nhé, lúc mình đi chỉ còn mỗi món ca ri thịt theo kinh điển, bán xong dĩa của mình rồi người ta dọn hàng luôn \n\nAh nếu mấy bạn đi Yaowarat từ hướng MRT và đi từ đầu đường thì khi đến ngã 4 thứ 1 hay thứ 2 gì đó bạn sẽ thấy một anh Tây đẹp trai lịch sự đứng trộn mì gói Mama với gỏi tôm thịt, giờ nghĩ lại thấy thèm lắm (thèm mì chứ ko phải thèm ông tây) nhưng lúc đó nó quá rồi nên chịu thua - ai đi ăn thử review giúp mình nhé, VN mình vốn rất thích mấy món chế biến với mì gói mà (chắc do ảnh hưởng thời sinh viên )Ngày 3 thừa hưởng thành quả từ việc ăn uống vô độ của hôm qua, thế là có cơ hội sử dụng toilet xịn của KS rồi . Bị cái bụng hành hạ đến mãi gần 1 h mới nhổ neo đc. Kế hoạch hôm nay là Platinum – Platinum thì cũng chẳng có gì đặc biệt để mà nói, hiện tại trước cửa Platinum có hội chợ , có vài món cũng ngon lắm ví dụ như Brownie factory 40baht 1 miếng cũng bự, kem tuk tuk, kem hàn quốc, nói chung cũng ko có gì đặc biệt lắm. Đi Bangkok sợ nhất là Chatuchak với Platinum, lúc nào cũng cảm thấy mệt mỏi quá tải ,và chẳng bao giờ đi hết đc 3 zone của platinum hay 10000 gian hàng của chatuchak. Riêng về Platinum thì mình thấy zone 3 – zone mới mở có nhiều shop bán đồ đẹp nhất ví dụ như áo thun nhái SUPERDRY của thằng MAD (thun xịn 200k, thun dõm 140k/cái , Ở VN đồ nhái superdry ở 1 số chỗ bán với giá thun dỏm 250k 1 cái) với quầy công sở hàn quốc của Miss Daisy (tầm 450 đến 550 baht 1 cái giá bán lẻ, đẹp và chất lượng lắm)…ến tầm 4h mình quyết định kết thúc thằng Platinum , xuống trệt uống ly trà sữa CoCo, giống y chang Hoa Hướng Dương, Thái Lan nổi tiếng trà sữa nhưng mình chưa kiếm ra đc điểm nổi bật trong chuỗi quán trà sữa ở Bangkok – Mr Shake, Miss Manon, Co Co …. Nhiều lắm, ai rành thì review để mọi người biết nhé (phải thật sự nổi bật mới nói nhé )"

[feedly]","\n\n---- \nA Better 50,000 Point Offer for the AMEX Business Gold Rewards Card!\n// Million Mile Secrets\n\nUpdate:  Doctor of Credit reports that some folks are able to get a 75,000 point offer with a higher minimum spending requirement.  I wasn’t able to see the offer, but others have had better luck!\n\nThe Military Frequent Flyer reports there’s a better offer available for the American Express Business Gold Rewards card.  You’ll get 50,000 American Express Membership Rewards points after you spend $5,000 in new purchases in the 1st 3 months.\n\nThat’s enough for 2 domestic round-trip coach class tickets!\n\nMy previous link for this card had a sign-up bonus of 25,000 points with the same minimum spending requirement, so this is double the usual offer.\n\nBut I’ll always tell you about better deals even when they don’t earn us a commission!\n\n\nEarn Double the Usual Number of Points With This Improved Offer From American Express!\n\nThe landing page says “Exclusive Offer for FedEx Customers,” but it looks like anyone can apply!\n\n\nWhat’s the Deal?\n\nLink:   American Express Business Gold Rewards 50,000 Point Offer\n\nLink:   My Review of the American Express Business Gold Rewards Card\n\nLink:   How to Fill Out an American Express Business Card Application\n\nYou’ll earn 50,000 American Express Membership Rewards points after you spend $5,000 in eligible purchases in the 1st 3 months.  The annual fee of $175 is waived for the 1st year.\n\nWith this offer, you’ll also get:\n\n25% off FedEx purchases (online and in-store) in the 1st 3 months, up to a maximum $200 discount\n3 points per $1 you spend on airfare purchased directly from airlines\n2 points per $1 you spend on purchases in the US for advertising in select media, shipping, at gas stations, and made directly from select computer hardware, software, and cloud computing providers (up to $100,000 in purchases per category per year)\n1 point per $1 you spend on everything else\nAccess to AMEX OPEN discounts\nNote:   Starting January 30, 2015, you’ll be able to choose your own 3X point category.  Here’s my post with all the new updates to the AMEX Business Gold Rewards card!\n\n\nThis Card Won’t Earn You an Award Ticket on FedEx, but You Will Get 25% Off FedEx Purchases in the 1st 3 months!\n\nThe American Express Business Gold Rewards is a charge card, so you won’t pay interest because you have to pay your balance in full each month.\n\nAnd read my post about how to fill out an American Express business card application.  You may qualify for the card, even if you don’t think you have a business or are just starting a business!\n\n\nEven New Business Owners Can Qualify for Business Cards\n\n50,000 American Express Membership Rewards points can get you a lot of Big Travel with Small Money!\n\nIt’s worth $500 when you pay for travel using the American Express Membership Rewards “Pay With Points” option.\n\nAnd the sign-up bonus is worth potentially much more when you transfer points to partners like British Airways, Delta, or Air Canada.\n\nSometimes there are transfer bonuses!\n\nNote:  You’ll be charged an excise fee of 0.06 cents per point when you transfer points to US airlines, to a maximum of $99.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThere’s a better offer available for the American Express Business Rewards Gold card.  You’ll earn 50,000 points after you spend $5,000 in eligible purchases in the 1st 3 months, and the annual fee of $175 is waived for the 1st year.\n\nYou’ll also get 25% off FedEx purchases in the 1st 3 months, to a maximum discount of $200 total.\n\nThis is double the usual bonus of 25,000 points.  I don’t earn a commission from this offer, but Emily and I will always let you know about the best deals!\n\nYou could get a lot of Big Travel from 50,000 American Express Membership Rewards points.

Arrive just before noon so that you can attend the service where the nuns chant acapella.\n3. De Halve Maan Brewery Tour. Again steps on the tour. Or you can just sit and have a beer.\n4. Chocolates, chocolates, and more chocolates!\n\nBruges is a very compact walkable city. We had dinner twice at the Gran Kaffee de Passage - some of the best lamb chops and ribs that I've tasted.\n\nThe Markt is in the heart of the town centre and is the perfect place to start the day. The square is surrounded by numerous medieval buildings and it is here that the Belfry tower is located, a tower which can be seen all over town. Those game enough to climb up 366 stairs just like the characters of the movie ‘In Bruges‘, will be rewarded with a fantastic panorama over the old town.\n\nBruges is very compact and perfect for exploring on foot. Head down Breidelstraat to another smaller square, the Burg. Surrounding this square is the Town Hall and the Basilica of the Holy Blood (named after a relic inside which is said to contain Christ’s blood). Pass over the bridge into Tanners Square, then follow the river around the corner to the right to Rozenhoedkaai, undoubtedly the most picturesque corner of Bruges with a beautiful view over the canals and Belfry tower behind.\n\nSimply wander around at your own pace, it’s easy to get lost but due to how compact Bruges is, equally easy to find your way again too. At some point head into The Church of Our Lady (note: currently undergoing some construction), then wander down Mariastraat, of course stopping via the many fantastic chocolate stores along the way."

"Travel","Guanajuato, Mexico","Where exactly is this place: In the middle of Mexico. Why you should move here: It's a cool, intellectual city. Some hack would probably call it the ""Brooklyn"" of Mexico. Plus, you can rent an apartment for around $6 a day, beer cost around a buck, and a movie ticket is a measly $3. Other things you should know: There are lots of mummies. Seriously. There was a cholera outbreak in the mid-19th century and so many died that a tax was placed on buried bodies. As many couldn't afford it, many corpses were disinterred and natural mummies resulted. Author of Fahrenheit 451 Ray Bradbury wrote a story called ""The Next in Line"" about his experience there. What you can do once you get there: Go and see the mummies. There's also a big, famous arts festival called Festival Internacional Cervantino, named after the author of Don Quixote, which is supposedly so wild that it makes Sundance look like a lame tea party.

Có 2 TTTM lớn: Central Festival (bán hàng hiệu, mới và rất khang trang, nhất Pattaya, khi sale mua rất được, Food Center ở tầng hầm hơi đắt nhưng không ngon lắm, các nhà hàng ở trên tầng 5-6, Cinema tầng trên cùng); Royal Garden: bán hàng hiệu, cũ hơn CF, Tầng 3 là tầng có chơi games, Bảo tàng sáp, Rippley's Believe Me or Not những thứ lạ và kinh dị, tầng 4 có food center, ngon mà đắt, có Sizzler ăn đồ Tây ngon và rẻ)\n2. Các TTTM nhỏ hơn như: Mike Department store (một ít hàng hiệu và hàng Thái); BigC ở Pattaya 2 có ST BigC khá lớn, bán thức ăn làm sẵn khá ngon như chả cá, và một số cửa hàng bán hàng hiệu\n3. BigC ở góc Sukhumvit và South Pattaya, rất lớn, có cả HomePro bán đồ gia dụng và nội thất rất rộng\n4. The Avene Pattaya: TTTM nhỏ trên Pattaya 2 road, ban đêm có chợ đêm bên ngoài, đi dạo cũng hay\n5. Tuk Com City: bán đồ máy tính và điện thoại, khá lớn, South Pattaya, gần Tops\n6. Outlet Mall: Thepprasit Road, gần chợ đêm, bán hàng factory, có nhiều thứ rẻ mua được, sát bên là Tops rất lớn\n7. BigC Extra: mới trên Pattaya Central, khá lớn, có HomePro bên trong, hàng gia dung và nội thất rất nhiều\n\nĂn uống ngon và rẻ:\n1. Siêu thị TOPS (Góc Pattaya Central & Pattaya 2): bạn vào ST, ở góc cuối, có 1 quầy bán Cá tươi, Thịt bò, Thịt heo, Tôm, .. rẻ nhất Pattaya và cả BKK, rẻ hơn VN, Bạn đặt mua, và nói họ chiên hay nướng. Sau đó họ đưa 1 thẻ cho bạn đi ra trả tiền ở các quầy checkout. Ra trả tiền rồi vào lấy thức ăn và ăn tại chỗ. Có Dao và Nĩa nhựa, muối. Có muốn tương ớt hay hạt tiêu thì vào ST mua. Ở đó cũng có Salad (bán theo cân, mỗi 100gm khoảng 20b, lấy tùy thích và tính tiền theo cân), có bán Sushi làm sẵn, bán cơm Thái, Trái cây, .. Nếu muốn uống bia hay nước ngọt, cứ vào ST mua và khi ra trả tiền, nói là đem vào ăn ở trong, họ sẽ dán tờ giấy màu đỏ lên chai bia. Nhớ trả tiền rồi mới ăn nhé. Ăn ở đây rể nhất, đồ tươi và giá siêu thị. Chỗ ngồi ăn chỉ cho 7-8 người, hơi ít.\n2. Ăn ở Central Market (Pattaya Central Road, xem bản đồ): đây là chợ, rẻ nhưng rất sạch và ngon. Vào xem thực đơn và gọi món như nhà hàng. Phía ngoài có bán xôi xoài, rất ngon, nên thử. Các món ngon là Cá diêu hồng lóc thịt chiên tỏi dòn chấm nước mắm Thái, Cá hấp chanh, Mực hấp chanh hay nướng, Tom Yum, Cà ri tôm, ... Tôi hay ăn ở quầy hàng chính giữa bên phải khi đi vào cửa \n(ăn xong có thể đi ra Soi Bukhao xéo phia bên kia chợ để massage chân, chỉ có 100b/một giờ, rất đàng hoàng, rất đông khách. Xem vị trí trên bản đồ)\n3. Quán ăn Beer Garden (trên Beach Road, sát với cửa vào Walking Street, phía bên bờ biển, xem bản đồ): \nhttp://www.pattayabeergarden.com/\nXem ảnh: https://www.google.com.vn/search?q=pattaya+beer+garden&espv=2&biw=1366&bih=6 81&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=vaL5U4TeJIXh 8AX3xYLwAg&sqi=2&ved=0CDAQsAQ\nMón 256, Talay Luak Jim, đồ biển hấp chấm mắm pha Thái, nếu bạn ăn mắm được: http://www.pattayabeergarden.com/menupage7.html\nMón 222, Penang Curry, cay: http://http://www.pattayabeergarden.com/menupage5.html\nĂn ở đây cũng ngon, giá hơi đắt hơn ở chợ, nhưng phong cảnh tuyệt vời. Tôi hay ăn món 256 và 222. Hay uống cà fê đá Thái. Bạn nên vào đây khoảng 4 giờ chiều, ăn tối rồi ngắm cảnh hoàng hôn trên vịnh Pattaya, và đợi tối đến, cảnh Tp Pattaya ban đêm với nhiều ánh đèn rất đẹp. Nên chụp nhiều ảnh chỗ này. Chỗ này tối đến rất nhộn nhịp vì là quán bar, có thể bạn sẽ không thích ở sau 8g tối.\n4. Ăn Sushi+lẩu ở Oishi Sabushi, có trong Central Festival (tầng 6) và trong BigC (tầng 1), khoảng 330B/1N, có Sushi cá hồi, Tempura tôm, cá Saba nướng, Lẩu dây chuyền, Kem, nước uống, ngon vỡ bụng\n5.

After that you will find several tata sumo to Sunauli. ( Nepal border). Will take around 150 rs. I suggest you to go bhairahawa bus park and then catch a bus to kathmandu. Hiring a cab and travelling is very expensive in Nepal. The bus fare will be about inr 500. You can find cheap hotels to stay in thamel in kathmandu. I suggest you to go basantapur durbar palace first. No entrance fee required. If you want to travel in kathmandu I suggest you travel in buses. Again cabs would be expensive. Next morning visit pashupatinath temple. I you have time you can travel to bhaktapur durbar square also. Then catch a bus to pokhara from kalanki. You can visit around pokhara for a day. Cheap hotels are available for Inr 300-500 near lakeside. If you want to zip lining, bungee jumping it will cost you around inr 3500. Next day travel to Sunauli from pokhara. \n•	I think 6000 would be enough provided that you don't travel in cabs in Katmandu and any where else in Nepal.\n•	Don't forget to get a government issued id card while coming to Nepal\n•	Enjoy your time in Nepal. In pokhara try eating thakali food once"

"Travel","Traveling in Europe","1) If you're taking a cab from the airport, always go to the taxi stand.\n\nI prefer to take public transit when I can, but when I'm tired and lugging two roller bags and a purse over cobblestones through an unfamiliar city where they may or may not speak English, paying the cab fare is totally worth it. Should you decide on a similar approach, do your wallet a favor and make a bee line for the airport's official taxi stand.\n\nThat sounds simple enough, right? Well, hold on a moment, because in many European airports, you'll encounter a number of ""taxi drivers"" hanging out between baggage claim and the taxi line, offering to let you skip the line. DON'T DO IT. The best case scenario for these guys is that you'll pay far more than is customary for your ride. Worst case is that they are criminals who will drive you somewhere dangerous and rob you blind. Either way, they're a bad idea. Avoid eye contact, give them a firm no, and get in line for a proper cab.\n\nUber also operates in major European cities at reasonable rates, so that's a completely valid option as well.\n\n2) Take public transit.\nThe Metro goes literally everywhere in Paris.\n\nThe Paris Metro is incredibly efficient and goes everywhere. No matter where in Paris you are, you're never more than 200 yards from a Metro station.\n\nWhile Paris is particularly excellent at public transit, just about every major city has it, and it's always cheaper than a cab. Opt for unlimited multi-day passes so you can hop on and off as much as you like.\n\nAnother reason I strongly recommend public transit has nothing to do with my budget and everything to do how empowering it is when I've figured out how it all works using a map written in a language I don't speak. After that, I get to pretend I'm one of the locals nonchalantly riding the train to wherever.\n\n3) Walk everywhere that you can.\nI never would have discovered this magical square if I'd taken a cab to dinner. \n\nYou're in Paris! Or Barcelona, Rome, Prague, or Vienna… you're in these gorgeous old cities where the buildings in which you're eating, sleeping and shopping often predate the existence of our country. So walk to dinner. Walk to the next museum on your agenda. Walk for no apparent reason other than you're there and it's a golden opportunity to take in all of its beauty and charm. Soak it up, because you may never be here in this magical place ever again.\n\nOh, and you avoid cab fare, too, of course.\n\n4) You probably shouldn't tip anyone most of the time.\n\nTipping is a practice in which we Americans are unusual. In Europe, servers, taxi drivers, and everyone else is paid full wages, and it's nearly universal that a service fee will be included in your bill. I know it's tough to break out of the mindset that we're stiffing a server if we don't leave 15-20%, but honestly the rest of the world thinks we're crazy when we do.\n\nIf you got really great service, leave a few coins on the table, but never more than €1. In the rare event that service is not included, 5-10% is appropriate, and Rick Steves points out that 10% is considered large. Anything more than that is really just throwing money away on an obscure American custom that no one else in the world actually follows.\n\n5) Eat lunch from carts.\n\nNutella crepes from a sidewalk vendor near the Louvre. \nThe best pizza I ever had and which I still have dreams about came off a food cart just outside Pompeii's exit gate. And if you're in France, you should be legally barred from boarding a flight home until you've had a crepe from a street vendor. Mmm, Nutella crepes… Honestly, if you're not hung up on sitting down for a meal, food carts are a very affordable and tasty way to get lunch on the fly.\n\n6) Eat Middle Eastern.\n\nI have a knack for unintentionally renting flats above Pakistani restaurants in neighborhoods with a high number of Middle Eastern restaurants.\n\nMediterranean food in Barcelona - inexpensive and kind of amazing.\n\nMost notably, in Barcelona, Las Ramblas del Raval is lined with with them, and it's also true for many major European cities thanks to the influx of immigrants from Eastern Mediterranean countries in recent years. All of them are cheap since the prices haven't been jacked up for paella-crazed tourists, and by and large completely blow away the shwarma we get in the United States.\n\n7) Enjoy the wine.\nLike French wine? It's €3 a bottle at the neighborhood Carrefour.\n\nA glass at dinner, always.\nSeriously, I've had amazing wine in Spain, France and Italy, and all of it was cheaper than soda - so cheap, in fact, that in the United States we'd instantly distrust it and write it off as swill based on the price alone. I capped my night off with a glass from that €3 bottle every night and it was wonderful.\nBy the way, if you're looking for a cheap souvenir gift that the recipient will actually appreciate, skip the chintzy fridge magnets and stash a €3 bottle of wine in your luggage. Trust me on this. No one needs to know it only cost you some pocket change.\n\n8) Always drink at bar instead of at a table.\n\nThis one was actually new to me in Paris, a great tip passed on to us by a wonderful tour guide. Coffee at the bar often costs half as much than the same coffee at a table. Same for any drink, and possibly for food if you can order it at the bar. This is now a permanent rule on my list.\n\n9) Linger over dinner.\nGive your glorious meal the attention it deserves. \n\nIn America, dinner is treated like something to inhale in the 10 minutes between soccer practice and math homework. In Europe, dinner is an event unto itself. There's no rush, so take your time and savor it. The French in particular take their food very seriously. It deserves your full attention.\n\nBut why am I including it on a list of money saving travel tips? Because when you linger over a meal that is itself a work of art, you're not rushing off to spend more of your money on something else.\n\n10) Rent a flat…\n\nI hate staying in hotels when I travel for pleasure. Hotels generally provide very little in the way of actual local flavor. My preferred way to stay in any city is to live like a local. For me, that starts with finding an affordable apartment to rent on Airbnb.\n\nBesides being a more authentic experience, living like a local is more economical. Do you really think the locals are hailing cabs to rush from one tourist attraction to the next and eating every meal in restaurants with jacked up tourist pricing?  We all have these romantic visions of lazy days spent in cafes like Amélie's Café des 2 Moulins (which is now a popular tourist attraction itself), but you'll never find them if you never leave the tourist track. Renting an apartment gets you away from the hotel strip and into the neighborhoods where the locals actually live.\n\nAcross the street from our Paris flat was a tiny general store where we bought bananas and the freshest, softest medjool dates I've ever eaten, a pharmacy (useful when you run out of the ibuprofen that soothes your sore muscles after a long day of walking), a patisserie on the corner where we loaded up on croissants and pain au chocolat. Call me crazy, but that's a good deal more authentically French than the hotel's continental breakfast ever will be.\n\nFinally, there's the whole question of internet access, which some hotels charge for (unless you have hotel status), or gate it behind timed login screens, or the signal is weak or overloaded with other hotel guests on the network. It can be an absolute pain, and if you've ever had to deal with hotel wifi, you understand the agony it can induce. I always look for an Airbnb apartment with wifi. When I show up, the owner gives me the password to their network and it's a done deal, totally hassle free, and it's all mine.\n\nIf I have any complaints at all about renting flats in Europe, it's that the bathrooms tend to be incredibly tiny, including showers so small you can't bend over to touch your feet, accidentally bump the hot water, or knock the door open while trying to shampoo. But it's a small concession.\n\n11) …and use the kitchen to make your own breakfast.\nAnd then there's the fact that your hotel room probably doesn't have its own kitchen. By virtue of this fact, hotels force you to eat out for every meal, or pay to eat in your room at an exorbitant markup. Not only does that get expensive fast, it also deprives you of one of my very favorite European experiences: grocery shopping!\n\nTruly, grocery shopping in a foreign country is an adventure. I love it. In the produce aisle of the neighborhood Carrefour, I found a small box of blueberries and a red berry I didn't recognize and couldn't translate (Duolingo never taught me ""groseilles."") But they looked wonderful, so I took the chance. They were red currants! I am now obsessed with currants. Why do we not have these in every grocery store in America?? You'll also find strange and wonderful new flavors of potato chips to try, that €3 wine I mentioned earlier, and plenty of stuff you'll recognize that ma\n\n12) Look for the ""free"" walking tours.\n\nI always like to schedule a tour of some kind for my first full day in the city as a way to get the lay of the land and figure out what I'm most interested in doing. Many tour operators offer a free walking tour, with the explicit caveat that the tourists are expected to tip their guide whatever they feel the tour is worth. (It also comes with a sales pitch for other tours which you do actually have to pay for.) Whatever you end up giving your guide as a tip, it's far less than you'd pay for any other tour.\n\n13) Google ""Free things to do in [your vacation city].""\n\nMost churches in Europe offer free admission, including Notre Dame.\n\nThis should be a no brainer. Hundreds of travelers before you have come and gone and compiled their lists. Plunder them for ideas. They may not always be mainstream, but when they cost you nothing it's hard to argue.\n\nBy the "

Today, it is Grade II-listed, with its beautiful gardens, lakes and bridges, children’s maze, two fountain features, Victorian bandstand and tea room/café.\n\nSTART\nFrom the car park, turn right on Westgate and right again along Bailgate. At the cobbled pedestrianised way, keep the White Hart Hotel to your left. This brings you to Castle Hill, with Lincoln Castle to your right. Built 900 years ago, the castle is one of only two in Britain built with two mottes.\n\nTurn left, passing through Exchequer Gate, to be greeted by the magnificent west front of Lincoln Cathedral. Walk right along Minster Yard, and left at the mini-roundabout to Pottergate Arch, passing the statue of Poet Laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson in the cathedral grounds. At the lights, walk right along Eastgate, and where the road splits, right along Greetwell Gate. Cross at the lights and angle right down Sewell Road, right on Eastcliff Road and left along Lindum Terrace to the wrought-iron-gated entrance to the arboretum.\n\n1. ONE MILE\nIn 2003, £3m worth of restoration work was carried out on the park, resulting in a prestigious Civic Trust Green Flag award every year since 2004, denoting a park of excellence.\n\nWalk past the play area into Coronation Gardens, opened in 1953 to celebrate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II a year earlier. Walk down the steps to the 300m Arboretum Terrace, where you can enjoy extensive views. There are various paths to the south-west exit, but for the best views go left at the fountain and follow the path down to the small lake with its numerous waterfowl. Cross the bridge along the path up to the Lion Monument and Grade II-listed Victorian bandstand. You can enjoy tea at the Abbey Lodge before exiting right along Monks Road to the traffic lights at Lindum Road. Cross and walk along Clasketgate, past the Theatre Royal.\n\n2. ONE AND THREE QUARTER MILES\nTurn right at the junction with High Street, and at the top, right again up The Strait. This connects withSteep Hill. At the junction of roads, take the second left up Wordsworth Street and along Drury Lane. Turn right on Union Road to The Lawn, set in eight acres of relaxing grounds.\n\n3. TWO AND A QUARTER MILES\nHere, you will find the Joseph Banks Conservatory, a tropical house themed with plants reminiscent of voyages the botanist took with Captain James Cook. Past the conservatory is the walled John Dawber Garden, which includes a sensory garden together with a garden representative of Lincoln’s twin town of Neustadt an der Weinstrasse, Germany, and its friendship city of Tangshan, China. Back on Union Road, turn right at the mini-roundabout along Westgate, back to the car park. \n\nTERRAIN\nFootpaths and short stretches of cobbled streets."

"Travel","FROM THE AIRPORT TO DUNC'S PLACE","The QUICKEST way to get to mine is to get the bus to ""Rudow"" (pronounced ""rude-oh"") from directly outside the terminal. Pretty sure the buses you want are X7 or X11, but don't hold me to that, just look for the name. \nYou then get off at Rudow U-Bahn and take the U7 towards Rathaus Spandau (Rudow is the terminus, so they only go in one direction - no confusion for you). Sit on it for 12 stops and get off at ""Hermannplatz"". When you get to Hermannplatz, you need to walk north (which is with Karstadt - the big department store - on your LEFT) and head towards Kottbusser Damm (which is the one that goes off at a bit of a funny angle, sort of north-north-west). \nBe on the RIGHT of Kottbusser Damm, and walk up to number 72 - it's directly opposite Woolworth. Ring ""Walker"" and someone will let you in. The lift is broken again, so I'm afraid you have to trek up to the 4th floor on foot.\nALTERNATIVELY - You CAN if you want get the S45 S-Bahn from the station which is a short walk from the airport terminal. You can take that to Hermannstrasse and then change to the U8 to Hermannplatz. This is the one for people who are weird about buses, but I think you'll be fine. It takes about 5 minutes longer"

"Travel","Why should you travel","There is nothing like riding a bicycle across the Golden Gate Bridge or seeing the Coliseum at sunset. I wish I could paint a picture for you of how incredible the Guatemalan mountains are or what a rush it is to appear on Italian TV. Even the amazing photographs I have of Niagara Falls and the American Midwest countryside do not do these experiences justice. I can’t tell you how beautiful southern Spain is from the vantage point of a train; you have to experience it yourself. The only way you can relate is by seeing them.\nRead more at http://convergemagazine.com/travel-young-5278/#O1BoeACRGy9voYOd.99\n\nWhile you’re young, you should travel. You should take the time to see the world and taste the fullness of life. Spend an afternoon sitting in front of the Michelangelo. Walk the streets of Paris. Climb Kilimanjaro. Hike the Appalachian trail. See the Great Wall of China. Get your heart broken by the “killing fields” of Cambodia. Swim through the Great Barrier Reef. These are the moments that define the rest of your life; they’re the experiences that stick with you forever.\nRead more at http://convergemagazine.com/travel-young-5278/#O1BoeACRGy9voYOd.99"

A 3-5 day course of Cipro is now commonly prescribed for knocking out the ill-effects of traveler’s diarrhea. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Spetra) and doxycycline are no longer recommended because of the high level of resistance to these agents. Doxycycline is a popular prescription for anti-malaria so be sure to ask your medical professional for the correct anti-diarrheal drugs.\n\nPepto-Bismal or other bismuth subsalicylate can be used, follow directions on package. If symptoms continue, seek a medical professional for possible parasitic infection.\n\nBring Pepto-Bismol or another bismuth subsalicylate for use either as a daily precautionary tool or after you suspect you may be at risk. My previous travel partner swore by Pepto. She chewed two tablets before each meal, every day claiming that kept her troubles away."

In fact, it's known locally as le Zie (the aunts). Here you'll taste the true cucina povera (peasant cooking), including horsemeat done in a salsa piccante (spicy sauce). Booking is a must.\n\nRead more: http://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/puglia/lecce/restaurants/italian/cucina-casareccia#ixzz3TbHlbSrk\n\nSEE\nTrani\nKnown as the 'Pearl of Puglia', beautiful Trani has a sophisticated feel, particularly in summer when well-heeled visitors pack the array of marina-side bars. The marina is the place to promenade and watch the white yachts and fishing boats in the harbour, while the historic centre, with its medieval churches, glossy limestone streets and faded yet charming palazzi is an enchanting area to explore. But it's the cathedral, pale against the deep-blue sea, that is the town's most arresting sight.\n\nRead more: http://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/puglia/trani#ixzz3TbHrbOdX\n\nAlberobello\nUnesco World Heritage Site Alberobello resembles an urban sprawl – for gnomes. The Zona dei Trulli on the western hill of town is a dense mass of 1500 beehive-shaped houses, white-tipped as if dusted by snow. These dry-stone buildings are made from local limestone; none are older than the 14th century. Inhabitants do not wear pointy hats, but they do sell anything a visitor might want, from miniature trulli to woollen shawls.\n\nThe town is named after the primitive oak forest Arboris Belli (beautiful trees) that once covered this area. It's an amazing area, but also something of a tourist trap – from May to October busloads of tourists pile into trullo homes, drink in trullo bars and shop in trullo shops.\n\nRead more: http://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/puglia/alberobello#ixzz3TbHvG2xc\n\nForesta Umbra\nThe 'Forest of Shadows' is the Gargano's enchanted interior – thickets of tall, epic trees interspersed with picnic spots bathed in dappled light. It's the last remnant of Puglia's ancient forests: Aleppo pines, oaks, yews and beech trees shade the mountainous terrain. More than 65 different types of orchid have been discovered here; the wildlife includes roe deer, wild boar, foxes, badgers and the increasingly rare wild cat. Walkers and mountain bikers will find plenty of well-marked trails within the forest's 5790 sq km.\n\nRead more: http://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/puglia/foresta-umbra#ixzz3TbHziqUc\n\n"

"Travel","Belize","http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/worlds-best-honeymoon-destinations-for-2014#!7-belize\n\nLocated in Central America, Belize is an incredibly compelling honeymoon destination for three simple reasons: its close proximity to the United States (a two-hour flight from Miami), its weather (around 84 degrees daily year-round), and the 190-mile-long Belize Barrier Reef. The reef is easily accessible along the coast and is wildly popular for snorkeling and scuba trips, fishing excursions, and romantic sunset cruises. \n\nThe country is hemmed in by the Caribbean Sea on the east, Guatemala to the west, and Mexico in the north. In addition to the Belize Barrier Reef, the country is gifted with pristine beaches, jungle and rainforests, and ruins dating back to the Mayan period. Belize attracts a variety of honeymooners, from nature-lovers to history buffs to diving fanatics to those who simply prefer to sit on the beach at their resort with drink in hand.\n\nWhere to Stay: If water adventures aren’t your thing but you’d still love to honeymoon in Belize, head to Ka’ana Resort in the western part of the country. This inland boutique resort is located in a valley in the Maya Mountains in the Cayo District. Luxurious 1,250-square-foot, one-bedroom private pool villas offer the best of indoor/outdoor living and are ideal for romantic getaways. From the resort, you can enjoy day trips to the Tapir Mountain Nature Reserve; Maya ruins like Tikal, Zunantunichm, and Caracol; Barton Creek Cave for kayaking; horseback riding along the bank of the Mopan River; or go jaguar tracking or bird-watching with expert naturalists and guides.\n\nPerfect for Couples Who: Want an authentic and luxurious but eco-friendly experience that blends the country’s culture with outdoor activities like zip-lining and cave tubing."

"Travel","Safary","Vé vào cổng: có nhiều cách mua nhưng Mua trên http://www.hotels2thailand.com/bangkok-day-trips/Bangkok-Safari-Park.asp khoảng 497B/pax (có buffet) còn mua tại cổng thì 1100B/pax. Mua trên Hotels2Thailand thì in voucher ra mang theo đến quầy vé ngay Safari đổi vé.\nNước suối: vì nhất định cần, ít nhất mỗi người 1chai. Trời nóng lắm, mua trong safari là 25B/chai còn 7-11chỉ có 10B.\nDù / nón: nắng muốn chết.\n\nĐón Taxi đi Safari World Bangkok\n\nLúc đi:\n\nEm đón taxi meter từ BTS Nana đi Safari, đi highway 40B + 180B = 220B. Thật ra ban đầu định bụng là 350B/lượt cơ, lúc trả tiền em còn không tin vào mắt mình nữa. Đường đi khá xa, đường thông thoáng không kẹt xe (em xuất phát lúc 10g), khoảng 30p tới nơi. Em có tip cho chú taxi nữa vì thấy chú hiền lành, còn giúp em kiếm toilet giữa đường nữa.\nThật ra lúc đầu đón xe đầu tiên chịu đi meter nhưng khi nó thấy em cầm cái voucher của Hotels2Thailand thì nó ko chịu đi nữa. Nó nói thẳng “you buy tickets I go, you don’t buy tickets I don’t go”. Chắc là taxi sẽ được chia hoa hồng. Cho nên mấy chị đi gặp taxi hiền lành, thật thà thì tip cho họ 1 chút ah.\nKinh nghiệm đón taxi của em là chọn mặt tài xế lớn tuổi hiền hiền, ốm ốm, nhìn giống người Thái Lan chứ không chọn mấy ông mập mập giống Ấn Độ.\nLúc về:\n\nEm đón taxi ngay tại cổng luôn, cũng 40B highway + 230B (kẹt xe hơn) = 270B. Nhưng tìm taxi lại là 1 câu chuyện khôi hài. Bác tài đầu tiên ko chịu bật meter, em đi hỏi tiếp xe thứ 2 chịu bật meter nhưng lại nói em phải chịu tiền highway 150B. Hồi sáng em đi qua trạm thu phí highway rõ ràng đề bảng xe 4 chỗ 40B, nên em nói không đi, lại tiếp tục hỏi xe khác.\nKẹt nổi nguyên hàng dài taxi đậu nối tiếp nhau, mấy bác tài này quen nhau hết nên mỗi lần em trả giá là cả đám người tụm lại nói tiếng Thái, đại loại như là “nó đi meter đó, mày chịu chở không?”, cũng hơi bực bực. Một hồi cả đám bác tài cùng trả giá, cùng kì kèo với em luôn. Nào là “kẹt xe đông lắm, lúc sáng đi highway 40B nhưng giờ về phải đi highway 150B mới về được”. Em nhất định từ chối vì “lúc sáng tao đi có 40B ah”. Kì kèo 1 hồi họ chịu “Ok, mày chịu tiền highway 50B nhé”. Mah rốt cục lại lên xe taxi đầu tiên ngồi. (điểm này em thấy dân thái đùm bọc nhau ghê, có trước có sau, nhường nhau mà kiếm sống).\nLúc qua trạm thu phí, vẫn là tấm bảng xe 4 bánh 40B, em cố tình đưa tờ giấy bạc 50B xem người ta có thối lại không? Ông tài xế nhận tiền thối 10B lưỡng lự nhìn em, rốt cục cũng đưa tiền thối cho em!!! Về tới BTS Nana, thấy tiền taxi cũng ít nên em đưa lại cái tiền 10B đó + tip cho bác tài nữa. Thấy họ cũng thật thà…\nThật ra, lúc về em nghĩ không phải mấy ông taxi ăn tiền highway đâu, mah họ muốn đi toàn bộ bằng highway, nghĩa là phải qua 2,3 trạm thu phí nên họ mới nói highway là 150B (chắc có kê lên chút xíu). Vì em chỉ đồng ý 50B highway nên sau khi qua 1 trạm thu phí, em thấy taxi quẹo ra khỏi highway. Lúc đi đường thường, em thấy trên đầu là cái highway. Chính lúc này mới là lúc kẹt xe neh, cà giựt cà giựt ~_~!!!\nXem thêm: Kinh nghiệm Du lịch Bangkok\nĐổi vé vào cổng \n\nBác tài lúc đi chở em vô tới quầy vé luôn (nhớ không lầm thì là quấy số 3). Tới đó họ có danh sách các khách mua vé từ H2T rồi, đưa voucher vô là làm rẹt rẹt liền. 1 pax gồm: Sticker lên áo vô Marine Park + vé đi Safari Park + vé Buffet trưa.SAFARI COACH BUS\n\nMua vé tại quầy vé, 30B/người. Xe chạy theo schedule, 1 vòng 30p.\nSafari Coach Time Table: 9.15; 9.30; 9.45 (Feeding Show); 10.00; 10.30; 12.15; 12.30; 12.45; 13.15; 13.45; 14.30; 15.00; 15.30; 16.00; 16.30.\nAdditional on Saturdays and Sundays 17.00.\n\n\nLỊCH TRÌNH THAM QUAN\n\nSafari Bangkok này gồm 2 khu:\n- MARINE PARK: xem show hoạt cảnh/ xiếc thú/ xem thú nhốt trong chuồng.\n- SAFARI PARK: chạy xe vô vườn thú.\nĐể gọi là đi hết công viên, xem hết tất cả các show thì phải có mặt lúc 9g sáng mới kịp thời gian. Em đi từ 10g tới 4g mah còn đuồi đuối hông biết mấy bé như thế nào nữa. Anyway, em up cái Show schedule lên cho mọi người sắp xếp trước, chứ đi tới đó lại lóng ngóng mất thời gian.\n\nMARINE PARK: mở cửa 9g – 17g\n\nShow Schedule (T9/2013)\nLion Feeding show (SAFARI PARK): 10g00\nOrang Utan: 10g20 (XIẾC) khỉ đột\nSea Lion: 11g00 (XIẾC) hải cẩu\nElephant: 11g40 (XIẾC) voi\nCowboy stunt: 11g40 (SHOW) cao bồi: hài hước, nói tiếng Anh.\nBREAK TIME: tranh thủ ăn trưa lúc này nhé.\nSpy War: 14g30 (SHOW) viễn tưởng: hoành tráng nhưng nói tiếng Thái.\nBird: 15g20 (XIẾC) chim\n\nBuffet trưa/ số 12: Jungle Cruise Restaurant\n\nChỗ này thì em ko nói nhiều rồi, ngon thì ko ngon lắm nhưng không tệ. Đầy đủ các món cơm, hủ tiếu, cà ri gà, gà roti, trái cây với chè. Nếu ko gặp đoàn du lịch thì ko có vấn đề gì hết. Buffet trưa phục vụ đến 2g chiều.\nLúc vào nhớ xem vé đánh số mấy rồi kiếm bàn đúng số đó mah ngồi. Quầy thức ăn cuối cùng sẽ ít bị giành giựt hơn.\nHighlight Atraction\n\nMini World/ số 13: chỗ này vui lắm neh. Cho chim ăn chim đậu lên tay mình luôn.\nJungle Walk/ số 14: chỗ bắt đầy khu chuồng thú là chuồng Hổ. Người ta có xây 1 đườgn hầm để mình chui vô nhà kính ngay giữa chuồng hổ. Hổ bự lắm, nhìn mah sợ khiếp.\nGiraffe Feeding/ số 18: cho hươu cao cổ ăn, 1 xô chuối 50B, cũng thú vị khi ngắm huo7u ở cự ly rất gần.\nSeal Cove: (ko biết)\nWalrus/ số 20: sư tử biển có 2 cái nanh ah.\nGiant Orang Utan/ số 19: con khỉ đột giống trong phim hoạt hình Tarzan ah.\nWhite World: xem hổ trắng với gấu Bắc cực.\n\n\nĐọc thêm: Tổng hợp Kinh nghiệm Du lịch Thái Lan\n SAFARI PARK: mở cửa 9g – 16g30\n\nKhu này thì ko có đi bộ mah bắt buộc phải đi xe vào. Lúc vào thì ngồi yên trong xe, cấm mở cửa ra chạy lung tung…. Có 2 cách 1 là mướn xe taxi, 2 là mua Coach Bus 30B/người.\nSafari Coach Time Table: 9.15; 9.30; 9.45 (Feeding Show); 10.00; 10.30; 12.15; 12.30; 12.45; 13.15; 13.45; 14.30; 15.00; 15.30; 16.00; 16.30.\n\nLúc em đi em mua Coach Bus để tham quan khu Safari nhưng nghĩ lại thì không nên 1/vì ngồi Bus của nó xe cũ hơi dơ dơ với hôi dầu. 2/Nếu tới h mah ko đủ hành khách thì xe nấn ná đợi thêm 5,10p mới chạy. 3/ Mình mah lên xe trễ thì phải ngồi hàng cuối. 4/ Xe chạy trong Park cũng co dừng lại cho mình chụp hình nhưng nếu đi taxi thì mình thích dừng lúc nào, bao lâu cũng được.\nĐi 1,2 người thì ngồi Coach Bus tiết kiệm hơn nhưng đi 3,4 người thì nên kêu taxi. Còn ai ko thích mất thời gian chờ đợi thì cứ kêu taxi, nhanh gọn lẹ. Em nghĩ mọi người sắp xếp đi taxi tham quan khu Safari xong thì quay ra về thẳng khách sạn luôn, như vậy cho tiết kiệm ko bị charge 35B tiền mở cửa lần nữa.\nTrên đây là những kinh nghiệm chi tiết về Safari world Bangkok.

This will allow her to explore more of the wilderness and the mountain.\n\n\nThe skill pool I will work in is: Side to Side Pressure\n\nEmily lacks sufficient angulation of the hip and spine which causes her balance/COM to be centered over the inside ski.  This does not allow her to apply sufficient pressure to the outside ski which causes the ski to skid out which makes turning difficult. I will help this skier learn to balance over the outside which which will allow her to apply sufficient pressure to the outside ski allowing it to engage.  This will help Emily make carving/turning easier which will allow her to enjoy more of the mountain and wilderness.  Because emily enjoys long term projects I’ll ask her to apply her newly learned skill on as many different trails as she can. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdging\n\nLack of proper ankle, knee and hip flexion causes the skier to use inclination instead of angulation to produce edge angle.  This shifts the center of mass over the inside ski.  \n\nThe outside ski has a higher edge angle than the inside ski.  \n\nInclination causes center of mass to move towards the inside ski which in turn causes the outside ski to skid out producing a higher edge angle.  This does not allow the skier to control the turn shape.\n\n\n\n\nUsing proper ankle, knee and hip flexion, the skier will learn to engage the edges evenly by using angulation of the joints.\n\nThis will allow the skis to edge the same time and rate which will allow the skier to use the design of the ski to produce and efficient smooth and controlled turns.\n\n\n\nClarifying question said she likes to explore the mountain while being outside.

This causes the COM to shift towards the inside ski which causes the outside ski to skid out creating a higher edge angle on the outside ski.  This does not allow both skis to engage evenly with the snow which makes turning difficult. By using proper ankle knee and hip flexion Barbara will learn to use angulation which will keep her COM over her base of support and allow her to engage both edges evenly.  This will help Barbara make carving easier and gain the confidence she needs to enjoy more of the mountain. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotary\n\nSkier is using the upper body to initiate rotation of the skis.\n\nThis causes the skis to rotate at a rapid rate through the shaping phase of the turn.\n\nThis skier is unable to control turn shape throughout the turn.\n\n\n\nSkier will learn to rotate the feet and legs under a stable upper body.\n\nThis will cause the skis to rotate at an even rate throughout the turn.\n\nThis will allow the skier to control turn shape through all phases of the turn.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim is using his upper body to produce rotation of the skis.  This causes Jim’s skis to rotate at a rapid rate through the shaping phase of the turn and does not allow Jim to control his turn shape.

This richly diverse area is also home to rare and endangered animals, including the Asiatic black bear, snow leopard, musk deer, brown bear, red fox, and blue sheep. Birds found in the park include Himalayan Monal Pheasant and other high altitude birds. At 3352 to 3658 meters above sea level, the gentle landscape of the Valley of Flowers National Park complements the rugged mountain wilderness of Nanda Devi National Park to the east. Together, they encompass a unique transition zone between the mountain ranges of the Zanskar and Great Himalaya. The park stretches over an expanse of 87.50 km² and it is about 8 km long and 2 km wide. Both parks are encompassed in the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (223,674 ha) which is further surrounded by a buffer... \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_of_Flowers_National_Park"

"Travel","Croatia","http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/worlds-best-honeymoon-destinations-for-2014#!11-croatia\n\nIf you love the Mediterranean but are tired of the crowds, it’s time to visit Croatia. While it’s gaining in popularity, peak vacation periods are not nearly as frenetic as their neighbors across the Adriatic. One of the best ways to explore the Dalmatian Coast is via cruise ship. You’ll call upon places like the city of Dubrovnik, which has been a bustling seaport since the 7th century; the island of Korcula, where you can bike, snorkel, or kayak; Split with the breathtaking Diocletian’s Palace—now a UNESCO World Heritage site—that was built in 305 AD; the fishing port of Rovinj; and the quaint island of Hvar with its beaches, lavender fields, groves of olive trees, pine forests, fruit orchards, and vineyards.\n\nWhere to Stay: There is no better way to get acquainted with Croatia than via cruise ship. Try the 694-passenger Azamara Quest, which sails a 7-night round-trip itinerary from Venice that calls upon Zadar, Split, Hvar, and Dubrovnik in Croatia plus Montenegro’s Kotor. Tere Moana, the intimate 90-guest ship from Paul Gauguin Cruises also sails round-trip from Venice with calls on Sibenik, Trogir, Split, Korcula, Dubrovnik, Hvar, and Rovinj. SeaDream Yacht Club’s 112-guest SeaDream II comes to the table with a Dubrovnik to Venice 7-night cruise that calls on Korcula, Hvar, Sibenik, Rab, Pula, and Piran.\n\nPerfect for Couples Who: Want a mix of Old Europe and a traditional Mediterranean cruise that offers plenty of beach time."
"Travel","Bora Bora, French Polynesia","http://wedding.theknot.com/honeymoons/honeymoon-planning/articles/best-honeymoon-destinations.aspx\n\nWhy go: This is what honeymoon dreams are made of: thatched-roof, over-water bungalows; crystal-clear turquoise lagoons; and swirling schools of colorful fish. \n\nWhere to stay: For the ultimate romantic rush, head to the super-luxurious St. Regis Bora Bora Resort (from $1,200, StRegisBoraBora.com) where you’ll find the aforementioned bungalows as well as a romance concierge. Yep, they’ll organize everything your heart desires, from a waiter sabering a bottle of champagne on your terrace at sunset to bespoke fireworks. \n\nWhat to do: View the majestic Mount Otemanu, which towers above the main island, by bike or by boat, then explore the inner lagoon via submarine or with diving equipment."

Max),\n>\n> As you know, there is the FCC week in Washington in March 23-27, \n> http://indico.cern.ch/event/340703/. The FCC project considers \n>  hadron-electron (he) including eA, as an option, related to the LHeC \n> project as an LHeC electron accelerator could provide the he mode even \n> if there is no FCC-ee.\n>\n> You can see a summary of the present situation in a recent talk by \n> Max, http://epiphany.ifj.edu.pl/current/pres/2-epMKcracow.pdf, and the \n> web page http://lhec.web.cern.ch/. The main news since we talked in \n> Napa is that a MoU for the ERL test facility has been signed between \n> CERN and Jlab.\n>\n> Btw, an LHeC workshop will take place next June 24-26 close to CERN, \n> http://indico.cern.ch/event/356714/.\n>\n> We would like to inquire you if you would be willing to give a \n> presentation on the opportunities given by eA collisions at those \n> energies (center-of-mass energies around 1-3 TeV/nucleon). We would be \n> most thankful if you could accept and give it. You would be a new \n> person talking on this, and it would be most appealing as the main aim \n> of the week is to attract people in the US to the project. The talk \n> would be short, some 15 minutes and, needless to say, you would have \n> all help on our side. You can see a summary of the available and \n> ongoing studies on eA in my talk \n> http://indico.cern.ch/event/350727/contribution/5/material/slides/0.pdf.\n>\n> All the best\n>\n> Nestor\n>\n> — \n>\n> Néstor Armesto\n>\n> Departamento de Física de Partículas and IGFAE\n>\n> Facultade de Física, Bloque 4, office no. 13C\n>\n> Edificio Monte da Condesa, Campus Sur\n>\n> Universidade de Santiago de Compostela\n>\n> 15782 Santiago de Compostela, Spain\n>\n> Tel.: +34 881814107\n>\n> Fax.: +34**881814086\n>\n> nestor.armesto@usc.es <mailto:nestor.armesto@usc.es>, \n> nestor.armesto.perez@gmail.com <mailto:nestor.armesto.perez@gmail.com>\n>\n> http://www-fp.usc.es/nestor\n>\n"

"Travel","Bangkok","Nok air is a handy and inexpensive airline for in country travel. Avoid long bus and train trips when possible for safety and comfort. The fare is only a few dollars more but it can save you 12 hours from Bangkok to Chiangmai. You can book online from here in advance. Their seats are packed right but most flights are under an hour so it isn't bad. They aren't too picky about bags either. I think each person can check 15 kilos worth, they don't care if it is 1 or 5 bags it is only the weight. We didn't like air Asia. Go see the Siam Niramit show in Bangkok we enjoyed it a lot. I also recommend the Queens textile museum at the royal palace too. If you go to the palace make sure you are there early because there is a lot to see there and most of the missionaries we talked to were not aware of most of the best things to see. We combined the day with visiting wat po (the reclining Buddha) and wat arun across the river. They are all right next to each other.\nWe went to Elephant World, and we also went to where they make silk. The silk place was my favorite! We also went to P-Lok, and I think that is where we went to a floating market that you walk on boardwalks to visit the shops. skirt and sandals....those will come in handy when you are desperate enough to use a squat toilet. That desperation comes easily for me. I hope your sandals are washable, too."

"Travel","Summer 2016 - Italy art tour w/ Father Dan","The best months for traveling in Italy are from April to June and mid-September to October—temperatures are usually comfortable, rural colors are richer, and the crowds aren’t too intense. From July through early September the country’s holiday spots teem with visitors. May and June usually see the highest hotel prices in Rome and Florence.\nAugust is the worst month in most places: Not only does it get uncomfortably hot, muggy, and crowded, but seemingly the entire country goes on vacation, at least from August 15 onward—and many Italians take off the entire month. Many family-run hotels, restaurants, and shops are closed (except at the spas, beaches, and islands, where most Italians head). Paradoxically, you will have many urban places almost to yourself if you visit in August—Turin and Milan, in particular, can seem virtual ghost towns, and hotels there (and in Florence and Rome) are heavily discounted, Just be aware that fashionable restaurants and nightspots are usually closed for the whole month.\nRead more: http://www.frommers.com/destinations/italy/253163#sthash.M19l4NnC.dpbs#ixzz3PO5GpFrS"

เท่าที่ทราบไม่มีบินตรงค่ะ สายการบินที่เราดูๆตอนก่อนจะไป มีดังนี้ค่ะ\n1) Qatar Airway \nที่เราเลือกใช้บริการ (ด้วยโปรโมชั่น 4x,xxx บาทนี้ ทำให้เราหน้ามืดตามัว รีบจองเพราะกลัวตั๋วหมด ไม่ได้รู้มาก่อนเลยว่า ตั๋วภายในทวีปช่วง ธ.ค. – ม.ค. นั้น แพงขนาดไหน)\nQatar ให้เราเลือกลงที่เซาเปาโล หรือบัวโนสไอเรส เราเลือกลงเซาเปาโล แม้จะไม่มีอะไรให้เที่ยวเท่าไหร่ ซึ่งก็ไม่รู้เหมือนกันว่าจะเลือกลงที่นี่ทำม้าย แถมต้องไปกลับทางเดิม ถ้าจะวนรอบก็ต้องเหนื่อยหน่อย ต่อเครื่องกันสนุกสนานเลยค่า\n2) KLM \nอันนี้ของดัตช์ ไป Transit ที่อัมสเตอร์ดัม สายนี้มีข้อดีตรงที่บินไปลงลิม่า แล้วกลับทางริโอฯ หรือบัวโนสไอเรสก็ได้ ราคาอาจจะสูงกว่ากาตาร์ แต่ถ้ารวมค่าตั๋วภายในเพื่อบินไปเมืองอื่น กับเวลาต่อเครื่องแล้วก็อาจจะคุ้มกว่านะคะ \n3) Emirate Airways \nบินไปลงที่ริโอฯ กับบัวโนสไอเรสได้เลย เป็นอีกตัวเลือกที่น่าสนใจถ้าได้ราคาดี\n4) สายการบินอื่นๆ อาจจะมีราคาดีกว่านี้หรือสะดวกกว่านี้ แต่เราไม่ค่อยมีข้อมูลเท่าไหร่ฮะ \n\n\nเมื่อปี 2012 สายการบินกาตาร์ออกโปรมาบินออกจากกรุงเทพไปอเมริกาใต้ 33,xxx เอง (บินไปกลับกทม.เลยค่ะ) เมื่อต้นปีนี้เราเห็นเพื่อนหลายคนได้ตั๋วในราคาสามหมื่นกว่าๆ (โปรแบบขึ้นลงคนละปท.) ถูกมากค่ะ อเมริกาใต้ไม่ได้เกินฝันอีกต่อไปแล้ว (น้ำตาจิไหลเสียดายคะแนน ROP ฮาาา) \nถ้าจะเที่ยวช่วงสงกรานต์ เราจะรอดูโปรเดือน กย. ตุลา ค่ะ สายการบินจะออกโปรเยอะ ปีก่อนเราก็รอโปรกาตาร์ปรากฎว่าไม่มีเราก็เลยแลกไมล์เลย 3 คน อีก 1คนมาแจมทีหลัง เราหาให้ได้ของเอมิเรตในราคา 61,980 ถูกกว่านี้ก็มีของเอธิโอเปียค่ะ เพิ่งเปิดรูทปีก่อนราคาประมาณ 52,xxx เวลาดีด้วยนะคะ ต่อเครื่องก็ไม่นาน ใครอยากแวะชิมกาแฟเอธิโอเปียด้วยต้องลองค่ะ\n\n\nมาดูสายการบินภายในทวีปกันบ้าง ซึ่งก็ควรต้องพิจารณาก่อนตัดสินใจซื้อตั๋วเข้าทวีปนะคะ \nสายการบินหลักๆ ภายในทวีป ที่เราได้ใช้บริการก็มีดังนี้\n1) Aerolineas \nสายการบินแห่งชาติอาร์เจนติน่า ถ้าใครบินเข้าอาร์เจนติน่าด้วยสายการบินนี้ จะมีตั๋วราคาถูกให้เลือกไปที่อื่นด้วย สำหรับบางจุดหมาย แต่เป็นสายการบินที่ห่วยมากสำหรับเราค่ะ มีทั้ง major, minor schedule change/ เครื่องดีเลย์หลายชั่งโมง แถมยังบริการแย่อีกต่างหาก\n2) Lan \nสายการบินนี้ถูกสุดเลย ถ้าต้องการซื้อตั๋วภายในทวีปหลายๆ ต่อ แต่มีข้อจำกัดว่าต้องบินเข้าสู่ทวีปอเมริกาใต้ด้วย LAN เท่านั้น (ไม่มั่นใจว่ารวมถึงพวกพันธมิตรด้วยหรือไม่)\n3) SKY Airline \nของชิลี บริการโอเค (ถ้าเทียบกับ Aerolineas ก็นับว่าเยี่ยมไปเลยค่ะ) ราคาพอรับได้เหมือนกัน\n4) TAM \nของบราซิล จองล่วงหน้านานๆ เหมือนตั๋วจะถูกกว่า\n\n\n\nสายการบินภายในทวีปอเมริกาใต้  ถ้าอย่างเจ้าหลัก ก็คือ LAN ซึ่ง ก็จะมีโปรโมชั่น อย่างพวก South American Pass ถ้าบินกับ LAN  หลายๆเที่ยวบิน มันก็จะลดราคาได้ \n\nหรือว่าการจองตั๋วของ LAN นั้น เวลาเลือกภาษาในเว็บแต่ละภาษา ราคาก็จะไม่เท่ากันอีก อย่างเช่น ถ้าจะบินในชิลี แล้วเราเลือก Country เป็น ชิลี บางทีจะได้ราคาถูกกว่า เลือกเป็น Other countries แต่ทั้งนี้ ก็ต้องดูดีๆนะคะ เพราะบางเที่ยวบิน จะมีเรทสำหรับ Resident ของเค้า เช่น LAN Peru นี่ ถ้าเลือกเวอร์ชั่นเปรู (ภาษาสเปนล้วนๆค่ะ) จะมีราคา 3 แบบ เห็นราคาแบบถูกๆแล้วอย่าเพิ่งรีบซื้อนะคะ เพราะราคาแบบ Base Plus นี่สำหรับคนเปรูเท่านั้นค่ะ คนต่างชาติซื้อไปนี่จะโดนปรับราวๆ 175 USD ตอน Check in เลยทีเดียว\n\nนอกจากนี้ เวลาจะเลือกซื้อตั๋ว ลองเปรียบเทียบราคาตั๋วเที่ยวเดียว กับตั๋วไปกลับดูค่ะ \nเราเคยหาไฟล์ทในชิลี บินราวๆชั่วโมงกว่า ตั๋วเที่ยวเดียวราคาเกือบหมื่น จะเป็นลม เราเลยลองคลิ๊กตั๋วแบบไปกลับดู ได้ราคามาที่สี่พันกว่าบาท \nสายการบินภายในทวีปอื่นๆ ก็จะมี Aerolineas Argentina ,  Sky airline, Star Peru , TAM , TACA  ที่เลือกบินกันได้ตามอัธยาศัย\n\nถ้าอยากประหยัดเงินอีกหน่อย เราก็สามารถนั่งรถบัสข้ามเมือง ข้ามประเทศกันได้ \nรถบัสที่นี่ก็นั่งสบายดีค่ะ แต่อาจจะต้องมีลุ้นว่าวันดีคืนดี จะโดนชาวบ้านมาประท้วงปิดถนนหรือเปล่า\nโดยเฉพาะที่เปรูกับโบลิเวีย เราเจอคนฮ่องกงตอนทริปที่โบลิเวีย เค้าไปเที่ยวเปรูมาแล้ว บอกว่าเจอประท้วงไปสองรูท รูทนึงเค้าใช้เวลาเดินทางด้วยรถบัสถึง 46 ชั่วโมง อีกรูทก็ต้องเดินเท้า พร้อมกับสัมภาระเพื่อข้าม Barrier ที่ชาวบ้านปิดเป็นเวลา 5-6 ชั่วโมง  \n\nแต่เชื่อเถอะค่ะ การนั่งเครื่องบินเหนือเทือกเขาแอนดีส ดูวิวกลาเซียร์ มันก็คุ้มค่าแก่การลงทุนจริงๆค่ะ   \n\n\n\n\n\nเสร็จแล้วเราจะไล่ดูตั๋วเครื่องบินภายในทวีปควบคู่ไปค่ะ หลักๆเราจะซื้อของสายการบิน Lan  เราเข้า cheapticket.co.th แล้วเลือกแบบ multiple (เลือกได้สูงสุด 3 sections) เพื่อดูราคาคร่าวๆว่าไป route ไหนถึงดีที่สุด แล้วค่อยไปเช็คที่ Lan.com อีกรอบ (ของ Lan เลือกได้หลาย section ก็จริงแต่เวลาเลือก multi-city จะให้ flight มาจำกัด บางทีเวลาไม่ได้ แบบว่า flight บินเร็วเกินไปเที่ยวไม่พอ หรือ flight บินตรงไม่มีให้เลือก ถ้าของ Cheapticket ดีกว่าเราก็จะไปซื้อกับ Cheapticket แทน) แบบนี้จะได้ตั๋วที่ถูกกว่า เราจะไม่ซื้อตั๋ว one way แบบแยกค่ะ เพราะรวมๆแล้วจะแพงมาก \nเช่น จากเมืองไทย เราตั้งไว้ว่าจากกรุงเทพจะไปลงริโอกับบัวโนสไอเรส (ตั๋วแลกไมล์สองเมืองนี้แลกง่ายกว่าที่อื่น) จะเริ่มที่ไหนก็ได้ เราก็เริ่มไล่เลยค่ะ เอาจากริโอก่อน ออกจากริโอไปเมืองไหนราคาถูก เวลาดี ค่อยๆสลับเมืองไปเรื่อยๆนะคะ จะไปชิลี หรือเปรูก่อน หรือไปลงโบลิเวียก่อนดี เสร็จแล้วเอามาเทียบกับแบบที่จะเริ่มต้นจากบัวโนสไอเรส ตัวอย่างนะคะ\nRio > Lima แบบ oneway ราคา 20,000 แค่ที่เดียวก็แพงแล้วค่ะ ค่อยๆบวกเพิ่มไปทีละเมืองนะคะ แล้วราคาจะลดลง อิอิ\nRio > Lima > Calama > Santiago > Buenos Aires ราคา  15,000\nRio > Santiago > Lima > Calama > Buenos Aires ราคา 16,000\nBuenos Aires > Calama > Santiago > Lima> Rio ราคา 18,000\n\n\n\nวลาซื้อตั๋วของ Lan นะคะ มีทางเลือกแบบราคาพิเศษค่ะ\n1.ถ้าคุณซื้อตั๋วเครื่องบินเข้าอเมริกาใต้ในเครือ oneworld เช่น สายการบิน qatar อันนี้ได้ค่ะ คุณสามารถเข้า lan.com ไปซื้อ South American Airpass แล้วซื้อตั๋วเครื่องบินภายในทวีปในราคาที่พิเศษ (จำนวน % ที่ลดไม่แน่ใจนะคะว่าถึง 50% หรือเปล่าแต่ลดเยอะกว่าที่เราได้แน่นอน ขอบคุณความรู้จากพี่ baddog@tkt  พอดีเจอกันที่เกาะ Easter เลยถามไถ่เรื่องตั๋วกันค่ะ) \n2. ส่วนแบบของเรานะคะ ถ้าทริปของเราไปช่วงวันหยุดสงกรานต์หรือวันแรงงาน เราจะรอดู Promotion ช่วง Black Friday (วันศุกร์หลังวัน Thanksgiving) หรือ Cyber Monday (วันจันทร์หลังวัน Thanksgiving) ปี 2014 ตรงกับวันที่ 1 ธันวาค่ะ ถ้าใคร subscribe email ของ Lan usa หรือทางยุโรปไว้จะมี email มาแจ้งค่ะ  ตัวอย่าง email ปีก่อน\n\n\n\nเวลาซื้อนะคะ ปรกติเราเข้า webiste Lan.com จะเลือก other countries ใช่ไม๊คะ ให้เปลี่ยนไปเลือกประเทศที่เราต้องการโปรค่ะ\n\nอย่างของเรา ตอนนั้น Lan USA ลดทุกเส้นทาง 20% ค่ะ แต่ตั๋ว Lan USA จะแพงกว่าที่อื่นค่ะ เราเลยมาดูโปรทาง Lan Europe ก่อนลอง search ดู ก็ได้ตั๋วไปกลับเกาะ Easter ลด 30% แต่ตั๋วที่ทำ multi-city (Rio>Santiago>Lima>calama>Buenos Aires) ไม่ลด เราเลยมาเอาส่วนลดที่ Lan USA (ลดทุกเส้นทาง 20%) แทน ของ USA เราใช้ paypal จ่ายนะคะ เพราะไม่รับบัตรเครดิตต่างด้าวค่ะ ส่วนของยุโรปใช้บัตรเครดิตได้ตามปรกติค่ะ  เว็บก็มีล่มนะคะแบบที่เรากระหน่ำจอง Air asia ช่วงโปรแหล่ะค่ะ \nอ้อ โปรของทาง Lan อเมริกาใต้เองก็มีนะคะ Lan Peru Lan Chile ไรพวกนี้ ใครเก่งภาษาสเปนเข้าไปจองได้ค่ะ เราขี้เกียจนั่งแปลแฮะๆ ให้ระวังราคา base price ที่ถูกเว่อร์ๆ อันนั้นเฉพาะของประชาชนในประเทศค่ะ ถ้าซื้อไปบินโดนปรับนะคะ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nผมใช้บริการของ sky airline จากที่นั่ง low cost ในอเมริกาใต้มา สายการบินนี้ผมคิดว่าดีที่สุดแล้ว โดยต้องไปต่อเครื่องที่ Puerto montt  (จริงๆไม่เรียกว่าต่อหรอก เค้าแค่บินไปจอดส่ง/รับคนแล้วก็บินต่อเลย อย่าเผลอเดินลงไปล่ะครับ)\n"

"Travel","KL city tour","What You Can Expect\n\nAfter morning pickup from your hotel, you’ll travel by air-conditioned minicoach through Kuala Lumpur, stopping for photos at Independence Square, the Petronas Twin Towers and the King’s Palace (Istana Negara). Your journey continues to the National Museum where you’ll peruse their collection of Malaysian artifacts dating from prehistoric times to the present. Afterward, you’ll drive past the Lake Gardens, a green oasis in the middle of the city.\n\nNext, you’ll see the National Monument, a sculpture that commemorates the Malaysians who died while fighting the Japanese occupation in World War II and in the Malayan Emergency. You'll also stop by the National Mosque and note its sleek and modern architecture, then contrast it to the blend of Eastern and Western design of the Old Railway Station. Your guide will share the history of these sites as you admire them from the outside. Your next stop will be the Royal Selangor Visitor Centre, where you'll see a elegant display of Malaysian pewter arts. \n\nAfter a full morning of Kuala Lumpur sightseeing, relax and enjoy a traditional Malaysian lunch at a local restaurant. Once you're refreshed, head to the Brickfields, a colorful residential neighborhood that's known as Little India due to its many Indian residents and businesses. \n\nFinally, you’ll drive to the craggy limestone mountain which holds the Batu Caves. An impressive golden statue of the Hindu deity Lord Murugan stands 140 feet (42.7 m) tall next to the 272 steps that lead to the caves. Your guide will take you through the cavernous rooms where you’ll find a Hindu shrine lined with colorful statues.\n\nOn your way back to Kuala Lumpur, stop at a Malaysian batik center to see how this popular textile art is made. Your city tour ends with drop-off at your hotel.\nPerfect for first-time visitors, this three-hour tour provides a comprehensive introduction to Kuala Lumpur's famous sights, leaving you with a knowledgeable base for exploring the city at your leisure. Meet your local guide upon pickup from your city hotel in the morning or afternoon, and embark on your narrated tour by comfortable coach.\n\n\nHead to multiple Kuala Lumpur attractions, making photo stops at the King's Palace — a symbol of Malaysian sovereignty — as well as Merdeka Square (aka Independence Square), which features a panorama of fascinating buildings in an array of architectural styles. Your guide offers informative commentary on the city’s growing skyline, whose ultra-modern structures tower above edifices with Indo-Moorish influence.\n\n\nGaze up at the Islamic geometric patterns on the 88-story Petronas Twin Towers, whose multifaceted walls and twin spires contain thousands of steel and glass panels.\n\n\nYour journey continues with a visit to the National Museum to see historic Malaysian artifacts, from traditional weapons and costumes to modern arts and crafts and musical instruments.\n\n\nThen, drive past the beautiful Lake Gardens on your way to view the National Monument, commemorating Malaysia's struggle for freedom during World War II. Nearby, admire the modern construction of the National Mosque and the pleasant combination of Eastern and Western architecture of the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station.\n\n\nVisit the six-tiered Chinese landmark of Thean Hou Temple, a grand structure that combines modern architectural styles with authentic traditional design. At the Central Market, browse a variety of local crafts and perhaps have your portrait sketched if time permits.\n\n\nThe final stop on your sightseeing tour of Kuala Lumpur is the Royal Selangor Visitor Center, where you will gain insight into pewter-smithing and see innovative pewter-ware design. Afterward, re-board your coach and end with drop-off at your hotel.\n\n\n "

As per our chat conversation, here is a copy of our chat transcript.\n \n[08:54:57] Customer: Hi ~  question about banking points…\n[08:55:05] Kiarra H.: Sure.\n[08:55:25] Kiarra H.: How may I assist you today?\n[08:55:41] Customer: We have 4550 points for 2015….…an we bank those points and use them in 2016\n[08:55:54] Kiarra H.: Let me check. One moment please.\n[08:56:51] Kiarra H.: You can bank 3550 of those 4550 points as 1000 of these points were banked from last year. Those cannot be rebanked and will expire on December 31, 2015.\n[08:57:02] Kiarra H.: The banking deadline for you is June 30, 2015.\n[08:57:34] Customer: Can we trade the 1000 points in for Marriott rewards?\n[08:58:35] Kiarra H.: The deadline to do that has passed. You must trade Vacation Club Points for Marriott Rewards points by March 31, 2015 for your 2015 Use Year.\n[08:59:01] Kiarra H.: You could use these points for an External Exchange Credit.\n[08:59:16] Kiarra H.: That is like an Interval International deposit.\n[08:59:34] Kiarra H.: That would extend those points.\n[09:00:07] Kiarra H.: Or you could use them to book a stay somewhere this year at another Marriott Vacation Club resort. Or use them in the Explorer Collection…eve…or airfare.\n[09:01:09] Customer: How does that work…. 100…oints earns what in Interval Intl?  Do 1000 points translate to a week?\n[09:02:54] Kiarra H.: This option also requires you to book through Owner Services via telephone. Then you would do the exchange through Interval Internatonal. External Exchange Credit allows you to use your expiring Vacation Club Points for a deposit with Interval International. The deposit is for a full week. The cost of the credit is determined by the Travel Demand Exchange Values and villa size. The credit can be used to stay at a non-Marriott property only. The credits cannot be changed or cancelled.  You will have to pay an external exchange fee. The credit will be valid for at least 2 years from the date of issue. External Exchange Credits do not have any restrictions waived within Flextime. External Exchange Credit will be available and in your Interval International account within 3-6 weeks.\n \nThe number of Vacation Club Points required may vary, depending on the location you would like to travel to, the seasonal demand, and the size villa you desire. To understand the seasonal demand, refer to Interval International’s Travel Demand Indexes (TDI’s) which are developed for every region within their network of resorts. These TDI’s are available on their website at IntervalWorld.com; and in their resort directory at the beginning of each section. They demonstrate the week-by-week demand for vacations in each area.\n \nThe charts are shown when you click on a resort's page, and then just next to the pictures of the resort is a link that says 'Travel Demand Index'.\nTDI: Peak – 140-150, High -115-135, Medium – 90-110, Low – 50-85\nStudio: Peak - 2,250, High - 1,750, Medium - 1,500, Low - 1,000\nOne bedroom: Peak - 3,000, High - 2,750, Medium - 2,250, Low - 1,500\nTwo bedroom - Peak - 4,500, High - 4,000, Medium - 3,000, Low - 2,250\nThree bedroom: Peak - 6,000, High - 5,000, Medium - 4,000, Low - 3,000\nFour bedroom: Peak - 7,000, High - 6,000, Medium - 5,000, Low - 4,000\n[09:03:24] Kiarra H.: That is a lot of information.

"Travel","Belize","http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/worlds-best-honeymoon-destinations-for-2014#!7-belize\n\nLocated in Central America, Belize is an incredibly compelling honeymoon destination for three simple reasons: its close proximity to the United States (a two-hour flight from Miami), its weather (around 84 degrees daily year-round), and the 190-mile-long Belize Barrier Reef. The reef is easily accessible along the coast and is wildly popular for snorkeling and scuba trips, fishing excursions, and romantic sunset cruises. \n\nThe country is hemmed in by the Caribbean Sea on the east, Guatemala to the west, and Mexico in the north. In addition to the Belize Barrier Reef, the country is gifted with pristine beaches, jungle and rainforests, and ruins dating back to the Mayan period. Belize attracts a variety of honeymooners, from nature-lovers to history buffs to diving fanatics to those who simply prefer to sit on the beach at their resort with drink in hand.\n\nWhere to Stay: If water adventures aren’t your thing but you’d still love to honeymoon in Belize, head to Ka’ana Resort in the western part of the country. This inland boutique resort is located in a valley in the Maya Mountains in the Cayo District. Luxurious 1,250-square-foot, one-bedroom private pool villas offer the best of indoor/outdoor living and are ideal for romantic getaways. From the resort, you can enjoy day trips to the Tapir Mountain Nature Reserve; Maya ruins like Tikal, Zunantunichm, and Caracol; Barton Creek Cave for kayaking; horseback riding along the bank of the Mopan River; or go jaguar tracking or bird-watching with expert naturalists and guides.\n\nPerfect for Couples Who: Want an authentic and luxurious but eco-friendly experience that blends the country’s culture with outdoor activities like zip-lining and cave tubing."

With glittering lakes, the country’s only bona fide forest and moody mist-ringed mountains, it’s no wonder 19th-century Romantics like poet William Wordsworth flocked here for inspiration. \nWhere to stay: Hidden at the end of a road is Lakefield Boathouse (from $1,700 for a 7-night stay, LakefieldBoathouse.com), a cozy B&B on Britain’s second-largest lake, complete with a private shoreline. Take the property’s rowboat out for a romantic afternoon paddle."

Sleep (in the same room) with them. \n\nYou'll start to learn not only how they live but how they make decisions. How they react to sitatuions. Things they do and don't enjoy. \n\nWhen I was in England I traveled with basically the same group of people (give or take a person or two) and looking back...I find it comical the conversations we had. \n\nThe kind that would normally make me blush and change the topic. And the kind that make you laugh so hard you start to cry and feel pain in your side. \n\nIn just a short space of time I felt liked I'd known these people longer than some of my oldest friends. I can detail the habits of my travel companions to a T. \n\nI guess it could all have been an act and these people are only the people I know because of the sitatuions we were in but honestly...it would have had to be awfully hard to put up a front for days on end. And given the fact that we were basically put in every situation on the planet...I can safely say with 96% assureance that I really know these people."

"Travel","New York - Sunday","Stroll through theConservatory Garden\nExperience the charms of a European garden without having to, you know, fly to Europe. This six-acre garden offers three styles (French, Italian and English) and a plethora of flowers, fountains, neatly trimmed hedges and walkways. Just be prepared for the throng of edding photo shoots, and by that we mean be prepared for photo-bombing. East side from 104th to 106th Sts, enter at Fifth Ave and 105th St\nFree tours: Meet at Vanderbilt Gate, east side at 105th St; Sat 11am; free. Through Oct 26.\n\nWatch the wheels go round and round at Strawberry Fields\nWalk through this stretch of the park, just across the street from John and Yoko's residence at the Dakota. Renamed Strawberry Fields in '81, after Lennon's murder in front of that building several months earlier, the five-plus-acre area features the Imagine mosaic, where Beatle fans from across the world pay homage to the late great. But don't sing the ground's namesake tune too loudly, as Strawberry Fields is also a designated quiet zone.West side between 71st and 74th Sts, enter at Central Park West and 72nd St\n\nRock the boat\nTake a romantic paddle around the Lake (hour $12, each additional 15mins $2.50, plus a $20 deposit)—or let someone else do the work, with a Venetian gondola ride (half hour $30). While you're there, absorb the picturesque view of the Lake at the Central Park Boathouse Restaurant, for fine—if pricey—fare like fish, crab cakes, salads and an assortment of wines. Mid park from 71st to 79th Sts, enter at Fifth Ave and 72nd St\n\n\n\nTrip on shrooms at the Alice in Wonderland statue\nDon't fret if the kiddies climb all over this bronze statue of Alice and company—that's what it's there for. Dedicated to the children of NYC and commissioned by George Delacorte after the passing of his wife, who enjoyed reading Alice to their children, the larger-than-life figures have been explored by children since 1959. Relive your youth and join them on the mushroom, or if you can't let go, read the engraved verses of the poem ""Jabberwocky,"" by Alice scribe Lewis Carroll, portions of which line the sculpture. East side at 75th St, enter at Fifth Ave and 76th St\n\nMonkey around at theCentral Park Zoo\nAnimal lovers will dig the cute critters at the Tisch Children's Zoo, adjacent to the main zoo, where you can also get up close and personal with goats. In the Central Park Zoo itself, coo over the daily feeding of the sea lions and penguins, and watch Snow Monkeys leap playfully between rocks. East side between 63rd and 66th Sts, enter at Fifth Ave at 64th St (212-439-6500, centralparkzoo.com). Daily 10am–5:30pm. $12, seniors $9, children $7, children under 3 free.\n\nRide your pony\nExperience the retro charm of bobbing along to organ music atop one of the Friedsam Memorial Carousel's 52 saddles. The carousel is in its third incarnation since 1871 (the original was horse-powered, and the next two were supposedly destroyed by fires), and the current version dates to 1950, when it was discovered in a Coney Island trolley terminal. Expect long waits, popcorn, hot dogs and a few crabby kids. Mid park at 64th St, enter at Fifth Ave and 64th St. Daily 10am–6pm (weather permitting). $2.50 per ride.\n\nClimb upBelvedere Castle\nTake in a sweeping view of the Great Lawn, the Ramble and Turtle Pond from Belvedere Castle, a folly built on one of the highest points in the park. Borrow a free discovery kit (requires two forms of ID, one of which is kept as a deposit) from inside the castle, which includes binoculars, a map and a guide for bird-watching in the Ramble's woods. Mid park at 79th St, enter at Fifth Ave and 72nd St\nFree tours:Meet at Belvedere Castle, mid park at 79th St; dates and times vary; vist centralparknyc.org; free.\n\nRomance your beau on the Bow Bridge\nNew York has no shortage of bridges seemingly custom-made for gazing into a lover's eyes and sighing deeply, and this one, which spans some 60 feet over the Lake, is one of our faves. Yeah, it occasionally gets crowded with tourist couples snapping photos, but that's with good reason. Mid park at 74th St, enter at Central Park West and 72nd St\n\nGet ready to Ramble\nThe winding trails, rocks and streams remain, seemingly waiting to be discovered. It's also the city's primo bird-watching spot, where you can view many of the park's 230 species. Mid park from 73rd to 79th Sts, enter at Central Park West and 72nd St\nFree tours: Meet at Belvedere Castle, mid park at 79th St; dates and times vary; visit centralparknyc.org; free.\n\nPeople watch in Sheep Meadow\nOn warm days, we're hard pressed to think of a better spot in Manhattan to ogle hotties than Sheep Meadow, the bucolic 15-acre field located along the southwestern edge of the park. Expect thousands of scantily-clad locals to take over the area on weekends. To secure a shaded spot, we suggest arriving at 11am, when the field opens. West side between 66th and 68th Sts, enter at Central Park West and 66th St (212-310-6600,centralparknyc.org)"

"Travel","Belize","http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/worlds-best-honeymoon-destinations-for-2014#!7-belize\n\nLocated in Central America, Belize is an incredibly compelling honeymoon destination for three simple reasons: its close proximity to the United States (a two-hour flight from Miami), its weather (around 84 degrees daily year-round), and the 190-mile-long Belize Barrier Reef. The reef is easily accessible along the coast and is wildly popular for snorkeling and scuba trips, fishing excursions, and romantic sunset cruises. \n\nThe country is hemmed in by the Caribbean Sea on the east, Guatemala to the west, and Mexico in the north. In addition to the Belize Barrier Reef, the country is gifted with pristine beaches, jungle and rainforests, and ruins dating back to the Mayan period. Belize attracts a variety of honeymooners, from nature-lovers to history buffs to diving fanatics to those who simply prefer to sit on the beach at their resort with drink in hand.\n\nWhere to Stay: If water adventures aren’t your thing but you’d still love to honeymoon in Belize, head to Ka’ana Resort in the western part of the country. This inland boutique resort is located in a valley in the Maya Mountains in the Cayo District. Luxurious 1,250-square-foot, one-bedroom private pool villas offer the best of indoor/outdoor living and are ideal for romantic getaways. From the resort, you can enjoy day trips to the Tapir Mountain Nature Reserve; Maya ruins like Tikal, Zunantunichm, and Caracol; Barton Creek Cave for kayaking; horseback riding along the bank of the Mopan River; or go jaguar tracking or bird-watching with expert naturalists and guides.\n\nPerfect for Couples Who: Want an authentic and luxurious but eco-friendly experience that blends the country’s culture with outdoor activities like zip-lining and cave tubing."

With glittering lakes, the country’s only bona fide forest and moody mist-ringed mountains, it’s no wonder 19th-century Romantics like poet William Wordsworth flocked here for inspiration. \nWhere to stay: Hidden at the end of a road is Lakefield Boathouse (from $1,700 for a 7-night stay, LakefieldBoathouse.com), a cozy B&B on Britain’s second-largest lake, complete with a private shoreline. Take the property’s rowboat out for a romantic afternoon paddle."

"Travel","New Zealand","http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/worlds-best-honeymoon-destinations-for-2014#!2-new-zealand-\n\nLand of the Long White Cloud, New Zealand tops Google’s list of trending honeymoon destinations and with good reason. If you and your honey enjoy active adventures in a natural setting, you’d be hard-pressed to find a more diverse destination. There are gorgeous beaches for swimming and sunbathing, freshwater lakes for fishing, fast-moving rivers for rafting, breathtaking fjords to explore, and mountains to climb. There’s even a region of active volcanoes. \n\nNew Zealand is also the only place on earth where you can see flightless birds like the kakapo and kiwi. The country—made up of North and South islands as well as a few smaller outer islands—may not be as populated as nearby Australia but it’s well developed and easy to get around by car. It’s a long haul to get there though: Air New Zealand flies direct from Los Angeles to Auckland. It’s a 13-hour trip.\n\nWhere to Stay: Located on 17 acres in Taupo in the central region of North Island Huka Lodge is the place to head for an outdoorsy yet decidedly upscale honeymoon. The compound, bordered by the Waikato River and Wairakei Park Reserve, offers opportunities for hiking, fishing, golfing, and day tours to White Island, Mt. Tarawere, Waitomo Caves, and other interesting spots. Within this natural setting you’ll also find luxury hotel standards like a swimming pool, hot tubs, and tennis court. The lodge is intimate with just 18 junior suites, the four-bedroom Owner’s Cottage, and the two-bedroom Alan Pye Cottage.\n\nPerfect for Couples Who: Enjoy active, outdoor adventures paired with a refined, luxury resort."

It was named Son Goong, meaning “Mountain River Cave.” Though it was discovered in 1991, it wouldn’t be until 2009 that British experts would explore the cave. What they found there was amazing.\n\nSon Doon is situated in the Phon Nha Ke Bang national park, about 280 miles south of Hanoi. The cave is 87 miles long and contains its own environment – animal life, trees, lakes, beaches, and a river. The cave also happens to be rich in rare pearls that have been shaped by water drops for centuries."

So maybe 600 to have some extra cash?\n\nhttp://flipnomad.com/2011/09/how-much-did-spend-chiang-mai/\n\nhttp://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/chiang-mai?currency=GBP\n\nhttp://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=Thailand&city=Chiang+Mai&displayCurrency=GBP · \n\n11 August 2013, 21:06\nI was in Chiang Mai in February and going again in December for a week and then further north. In Chiang Mai, a beer was about 60-80 baht (about $3.50) - cheap and very good! Singha or Chang, and I liked them both; you'll see street food everywhere, and it is very cheap and delicious; it's an adventure - you choose something and see if you like it; if you don't, try something else. A lot of it is made fresh every day, and I never had any stomach problems from eating off street carts in Chiang Mai. It is also very cheap - I spent about $10 a day or much less for food each day. I also went to 2 nice restaurants - one at the start of my trip and another on my last night in Chiang Mai (both were riverside restaurants - Deck 1 and River Market Restaurant), and even then, they were cheaper than restaurants I go to at home, but MUCH better ambience and the food was wonderful!\n\nThere is a Sunday Walking Market that starts about 5pm - if you're there on that day, don't miss it! It's amazing. There is also a Night Market open every night that is fun to explore but not as good as Sunday mkt - you'll still find some good souvenirs there though. Warorot Mkt is open every day and very interesting, and there is also a wonderful flower market - there are many markets in Chiang Mai.\n\nAs for transport around Chiang Mai, I mostly took tuktuks - motorcycles with a little cabbose in the back that holds 2 people comfortably. Fun and cheap - most rides cost me about 80 - 120 baht ($3 or $4) around the city. There are also ""songthaews"", basically pickup trucks with a roofed over section in the back that holds about 10 people (or more), and is very cheap - maybe 20baht - $1.00, and they go on specified routes around the city and to other places like Doi Suthep which is definitely a place you should see. You can also rent a taxi and driver if you want to go to places outside the city like Baan Tawai which is a great place to shop! Your hotel can help you with transport.\n\nChiang Mai is a great place to just wander - there is so much to see and some 300 magnificent temples! Little hole-in-the-wall restaurants with great food. I wandered into one little place and asked for Pad Thai, and it was the best I ever tasted! I actually swooned when I first tasted it. Try and learn a few Thai phrases before you go - the Thai people will love you for it and their smiles when you say hello in Thai are beautiful...\n\nThe coffee in Thailand is wonderful and in Chiang Mai, I had iced cuppochinos, coffee smoothies and what have you - all so delicious. Lots of different kinds of teas as well.\n\n"

"Travel","Agadir to Essaouira ","BUSSES (upt. 2014)\nThe long distance Grand taxis can be expensive if there is nobody to share with travelling in the same direction, so I would take a taxi from the airport to the big main bus station at Inezgane and take a bus from there direct to Essaouira bus station in Avenue Deuxieme Mars. This means you will be arriving  in Essaouira very late in the day or even during the night, I have done this before with no problems, Essaouira Gare Routiere (bus station) operates around the clock.\n\nTAXI (upd. 2013)\nIt is a three and a half hour journey from Al Massira airport to Essaouira and the driver may stop for refreshments roughly halfway.\nI expect the fare to be in the region of 600-800Dh for both of you but when you are at the airport check near the exit as there was a display with approved fares to various locations from the airport.\nKnowing this will give you peace of mind as any ensuing arguments with the driver will be avoided. There will also be an additional charge for luggage of 20Dh or so.\nI checked out a Moroccan taxi shuttle service going between the two cities who charge 750Dh per head but this will be doubled as the requirement is a mniumum of 4 people so you have to pay for the empty seats if you want the taxi for yourselves, 3000Dh in total or €300!\nTaxis between the two locations will not have aircon although the bus will.\nThe absolute cheapest way is to get a taxi from the airport to Inezgane, which the taxi passes through to get to Agadir and Essaouira. You then get a shared taxi from Inezgane to Essaouira at about 130Dh per person BUT you will have about four other people crammed in which is very uncomfortable for such a long journey."

"Travel","Vancouver","Train:\nYou also can use Amtrak to get from Seattle to Vancouver.  Note, however, that the Cascades train covers the scenic rail route only twice a day in each direction.  Amtrak's other offerings are actually buses that use the less scenic road route.      \n\nOne suggestion is to take the Amtrak train from Vancouver back to Seattle. In summer it stays light till late 9:30 or so and the train leaves at 6 pm and follows the water back to the border and into downtown Seattle.\n\nThe two trains a day run from each city at approximately 7:30 am and 7:00 pm. (check Amtrak for exact times).  The evening train out of Seattle is a continuation of the train from Portland, and therefore does not always leave on time. The other trains are usually on time leaving and within about 10 minutes of on-time arriving.\n\nMore detailed information about Amtrak's evening train from Vancouver to Seattle is available on the TripAdvisor page entitled Inside Seattle : Getting Here from Vancouver by Train. \n\n\n\nHow We Rank Things to Do\nRankingsFree\n#1\nStanley Park\nStanley Park Free attraction\nParks and Gardens, Recreation | MAP IT\nOverall Rating: Rating: 5.0\n\nWhy go: This nearly 1,000-acre park on the tip of Vancouver's ""thumb"" (just north of the West End) is home … read more»\n#2\nGranville Island\nGranville Island Free attraction\nShopping, Neighborhood/Area | MAP IT\nOverall Rating: Rating: 4.5\n\nWhy go: This former industrial site is now one of Vancouver's most beloved neighborhoods.

Якщо загуглити на фразу типу «Отримати шенген у Києві» то можна побачити ціни які стартують від 200 – 300€ і закінчуються в районі 2000€. Жах. Але насправді це все фігня, на яку не варто витрачати час. Зараз я вам розповім як отримати словацький мульти шенген швидко і майже безкоштовно.\nОтже поїхали:\n1. В першому пункті ми визначемося зі списком документів, які нам будуть необхідні, а саме:\n• Заповнена і роздрукована анкета, підписана власноруч.\n• 2 фото шенгенського зразка (3.5х4.5см, 80% обличчя)\n• скан-копія ваучеру з місця проживання в Словаччині (з підписом та печаткою, не оплачений).\n• Копія студентського квитка (оригінал на подачу)\n• Довідка з місця навчання.\n• Виписка з банку про наявність достатніх коштів на рахунку.\n• Копія усіх сторінок з відмітками внутрішнього паспорта (оригінал на подачу)\n• Оригінал закордонного паспорта + копії 1-ї сторінки і шенген віз за останні 3 роки\n• Страховка на першу подорож\n• Не оплачене бронювання квитків в обидві сторони на першу подорож .\n\n2. Тепер розберемо окремо кожен пункт, почнемо з “найбільш не зрозумілого”.\nА саме з “ваучеру” з місця проживання. Насправді це те ж саме бронювання готелю/хостелу але назване модним словом. Як його отримати?\nЗаходимо на http://www.booking.com/, шукаємо будь який хостел/готель на території Словаччини, копіюємо його назву і шукаємо в гуглі його офіційний сайт. Там пишемо (звичайно англійською) через форму зворотнього зв’язку, що ми туристи з України, бажаємо зупинитися у вас в готелі, але для отримання візи нам потрібна від вас скан-копія ваучеру з підписом та печаткою, і що в ваучері необхідно зазначити наступну інформацію: ПІБ, номер паспорту, дати заїзду і виїзду, загальну вартість.\nЯ писав таке повідомлення до трьох хостелів, перші два відповіли, що спочатку необхідно заплатити, а третій вислав підтвердження бронювання.\n3. Анкета. Йдемо на веб-сторінку https://ezov.mzv.sk/ , заповнюємо анкету онлайн, ставимо позначку,що хочемо її скачати і призначаємо дату подачі документів(на процесі заповнення анкети я не буду детально зупинятися, так як цієї інформації в мережі вдосталь, тільки напишу, що просіть відразу мульти візу на два роки якщо у вас чистий паспорт, і на п’ять років, якщо є хоча б один використаний шенген).\n4. Дві звичайні фотокартки. Скажіть у фото салоні, що вам необхідно фото на візу, там зазвичай все знають. Зробіть копію вашого студентського, сходіть в універ/коледж та візьміть у секретаря довідку, що ви там навчаєтесь. Також сходіть до будь якої відомої страхової компанії і зробіть страховку. Скажіть, що вам необхідна мінімальна програма. (в мене коштувало 36грн. на 5 днів з місячним коридором). Там же попрохайте зробити копію полісу. Ще не забудьте зробити ксерокопії усіх сторінок внутрішнього паспорту а також першої сторінки закордонного + ксерокс попередніх віз і штампів по них.\n5. Виписка з банку. Позичаєте у рідних чи друзів сумму з розрахунку 40-50€ на день (так – так, правильна мінімальна сумма близько 56€/доба, але консул дозволяє мати і трохи меншу суму). З цією сумою йдете в приват банк (це не реклама, просто там дійсно найпростіше все зробити, при бажанні можна використовувати будь який інший банк) і говорите що ви бажаєте відкрити «приват вклад». Вносите суму на рахунок, приходите на наступний день після обіду, робите виписку про наявність коштів на рахунку. ( не виписку про рух коштів, а саме виписку про наявність коштів). І після цього знімаєте кошти (якщо у вас є картка «для виплат» то взагалі без комісії).\n6. Бронювання квитків. Переходите по посиланню http://e-travels.com.ua (це знову таки не реклама, пишу як робив сам) тут вибираємо необхідний напрямок, наприклад Ужгород – Кошице – Ужгород, бронюємо квиток. Там дається бронь на 24 години, ви її роздруковуєте і вкладаєте до папки з документами.\n\nЩо ж, з документами розібралися, призначили дату подачі документів. Тепер ще раз все перевірте:) В призначений день йдемо до консульського відділу, який знаходиться за адресою вул. Паторжинського, 14, м. Київ 01034, Україна , станція метро «Золоті ворота». Черг там нема, але я прийшов раніше і мене відразу ж прийняли. Платити вам там нічого не треба буде. Також постарайтеся одягнути на себе як можна менше заліза, і повитягайте з карманів усе, бо там стоїть рамка і я там застряг на хвилин п’ять,. Як виявилося та рамка реагувала на гумку в кишені.\n\nОсь і все:) Я таким способом отримав мульти шенген на 90 днів з терміном перебування в шенгенській зоні місяць. (Перед цим було два однократних шенгени, польський та швейцарський).\nПрикріпляю фото своєї візи, за яку я заплатив лише 56грн (36грн страховка і 20грн дві фотографії) і маршрут як дістатися до консульства від ст. метро «Золоті ворота».\nЯкщо ця інформація була для Вас корисна, або хоча би цікава – ставте лайк та робіть репост!"

"Travel","Усадьбы","7 заброшенных усадеб Подмосковья\n\n1. Усадьба Гребнева\n\nОбширный архитектурно-парковый ансамбль, которому присвоен статус историко-архитектурного памятника федерального значения. История усадьбы известна еще с конца 16 века. Усадьба была устроена с грандиозным размахом! Здесь было возведено 8 каменных зданий, большинство из которых построены в готическом стиле, а за усадьбой был построен летний храм Гребневской Божьей Матери. В 1991 году здание погубил жуткий пожар; с тех пор оно пустует. Теперь былой дворец грозит окончательно превратиться в руины, но его красота и размах впечатляют и по сей день. А вокруг раскинулись великолепные пейзажи с мощными суровыми лесами и холмистыми полянами!\n\nКак добраться: по Щелковском шоссе, поворот на г.Щелково, далее через весь город на Фрязино. Проехав Фрязино, сразу за мостом через р.Любасеевку повернуть направо по указателю ""Гребневская церковь», далее через село. На автобусе: м. Щелковская, далее авт. 361 до Фрязино, далее авт. 23, марш. такси 20. \n\n2. Усадьба Константиново (дом Пржевальского)\n\nКрасивое здание неподалеку от Домодедово, построенное в 1820-х годах. Одним из ее владельцев успел побыть родной брат знаменитого путешественника Пржевальского. После революции она была национализирована и начала постепенно разрушаться. До наших дней от усадьбы остался лишь только полуразложившееся главное здание. В стенах его еще сохранились внутренние перегородки, колонны и лестницы. От былых лет остались также живописные каскадные пруды. Усадьба ограждена забором, но, по свидетельствам очевидцев, внутри него довольно много проходов, так что для самых любопытных попадание внутрь вполне осуществимо. \n\nКак добраться: на электричке с Павелецкого вокзала до ст. ""Домодедово"", затем - пересадка на авт. 33 станции Домодедово - Племсовхоз до остановки ""Фабрика"".\n\n3. Усадьба Ляхово\n\nЕще одна заброшенная усадьба в Домодедовском районе. История ее уходит корнями в начало 17 века. Главное здание усадьбы представляет собой кирпичный дом с мезонином, выполненные в стиле классицизма. Внутри дома сохранились внутренние перегородки, некоторые двери, лестница, ведущая на второй этаж. От усадьбы, расположенной на холме, открывается красивый вид на окружающий ландшафт и застройку. Состояние построек усадьбы, к сожалению, очень плохое.\n\nКак добраться: от Павелецкого вокзала до ст. ""Барыбино"", далее - на автобусе: №43 (Ст. Барыбино - Кишкин (ч/з Сырьевой, Ильинское, Ляхов) либо №56 Ст. Барыбино - Бол. Алексеевское (ч/з Сырьевой, Ильинское, Ляхов, Кишкин). \n\n4. Дом Р.В. Германа \n\nЗаброшенная усадьба столетнего возраста в городе Долгопрудном. Построена усадьба была в 1912 году. В советские годы здесь находился санаторий для больных туберкулезом. В начале девяностых в здании обвалился потолок, и хозяева санатория перестали тратить деньги на поддержание особняка должном виде.Усадьба очень красива и снаружи, и внутри, где сохранились лестница, балконы, деревянные двери, камины. Усадьба охраняется, но, по слухам, с охраной вполне можно договориться.\n\nКак добраться: усадьба находится недалеко от здания 167с3 по Дмитровском шоссе, вблизи Долгопрудном аллеи.\n\n5. Усадьба Пущино-На-Нара\n\nБывшая загородная усадьба князей Вяземский на берегу реки Нара в деревне Пущино под Серпуховом, построенная в стиле строгого классицизма. В настоящее время здание больше походит на величественную театральную декорацию, нежели бывшую здесь когда-то усадьбу. Здесь сохранились могущественные корейские колонны, чаши фонтанов, аллея с красивым видом и искусная лепнина на фасаде. К сожалению, средств на полноценные реставрационные работы усадьбы не выделяют, так что скоро этот памятник архитектуры грозит полностью исчезнуть.\n\nКак добраться: от Москвы до Серпухова - на электричке. От железнодорожной станции Серпухов автобусом №29 на Павшино до остановки ""отделение совхоза ""Большевик"" (примерно 500 метров за одноактным железнодорожным переездом), далее 50 м. пешком.\n\n6. Усадьба Семеновской-Отрада\n\nСтаринная усадьба графов Орловых. В советские годы эта усадьба считалась одной из самых благополучных и закрытых: там находился санаторий КГБ. Но в наше время усадьба заброшена и постепенно разрушается. Несмотря на плачевное состояние, усадьба Орловых поражает своим великолепием и размахом. Находится под охраной, но самые старательные внутрь все-таки попадают.\n\nКак добраться: от Павелецкого вокзала - до ст. ""Михнев"", далее - автобусом до станции ""Санаторий ФСБ"".\n\n7. Усадьба Чернышевых \nОчень классно!!!\n\nУсадьба неподалеку от города Ярополец, которую в свое время по праву называли «Русским Версалем». В свое время здесь располагалось роскошное барское имение с дворцом, храмом, множеством служебных построек и огромным парком. В первые месяцы Великой Отечественной войны усадьба была серьезно разрушена немецкими войсками. Здание усадьбы с тех пор фактически не реставрировали. Особый интерес, помимо главного здания, представляет расположившаяся на территории усадьбы великолепная церковь Казанской Иконы Божией Матери – уникальный памятник храмовой архитектуры XVIII века. В настоящее время территория усадьбы отгорожена от дороги двухметровым железным забором\n\nКак добраться: электричкой до Волоколамская от Рижского вокзала, далее - автобусом 28 до Яропольца, от остановки - пешком."

NC does okay, Okey is good quality and Texas has some decent styles, but for a people that take it to a whole cultural level above...KC. That place is the Mecca of BBQ. Specifically Lenexa. Everyone talks about the American Royal being the World Championship of BBQ, but there's this town south on I-35 from KC that has a competition that is hard to match. Every single person is extremely opinionated and educated about every aspect, more than vineyard managers in Burgundy are about their grapes! It's crazy.\n\nhttp://www.lenexa.com/parks/festivals_bbq.html\nhttp://www.kansastravel.org/kansascitybbq/"

Such a temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome was once widespread throughout the whole Central Valley. The 2,826-acre (1,144 ha) park was established in 1982. Largely undeveloped, it was formed by combining two former state park units: San Luis Island and Fremont Ford State Recreation Area. Its chief attractions for visitors are spring wildflowers, fishing, and wildlife watching.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Valley_Grasslands_State_Park\n\nThe park preserves one of few intact examples of native grasslands on the floor of the Central Valley. The park is part of the larger Grasslands Ecological Area (GEA) of federal, state and private lands all managed for wildlife values. The GEA represents the largest remaining contiguous block of wetlands in California. Several rare and endangered plant and animal species inhabit the park, including alkali sacaton, a native bunch grass, and the Delta button celery (Eryngium racemosum) a state listed endangered species found in the flood plain of the San Joaquin River. Biologists have also reported the California Tiger Salamander and endangered vernal pool fairy shrimp and tadpole shrimp. Springtime wildflower displays, fishing and wildlife watching attract visitors to this undeveloped park, which also encompasses the former Fremont Ford State Recreation Area.\nhttp://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=559\n\nThe park is located south of Stevinson, CA, 1 mile south of highway 140 on Highway 165.\n"

Or at least trying to get to my vacation. It’s abouts 8AM here in Chicago (so about 9 back home). What time did I wake up? Oh that’s right. 3:14AM. Left my house at 4 to make it to the airport by 5 for a flight at 6. I got a lovely window seat at the gate so I go to stare at complete darkness until I boarded (group 2, yeah baby). The flight was uneventful, albeit it delayed (but nice and dark so I got in a good 30 minutes nap). Landed in Chicago O’hare around 6:22A. Sat around in the handicapped seat for a bit but got too uncomfortable (because I felt awkward sitting in a handicapped chair and because I still hadn’t eaten at this point) so I got up to find a loo, some water, and more importantly, some food and a quiet place to sit.\n\nWhich brings me to now-ish. I was wandering around Terminal 3 a-la Tom Hanks only with a ridunkulous amount of baggage looking for food when I found a place that reminded me a lot of the Upper Crust (a little café chain found in airports and train stations across England). We went there a few times on our early morning departures and I distinctly remember one time I got a croissant which made me ill (but it was oh so good) and another time I got a cranberry orange muffin (note: where I just bought one, they called it an Orange Cranberry muffin).\n\nIt was VERY orange-y, moderately small, and very enjoyable. YUM!\n\nLet’s compare it to muffins in ‘Murica. The muffin was bloody huge. It’s muffin top had a muffin top.\n\nAnd it seriously lacked orange flavour. I’m not a fan of orange to begin with (in any form except orange juice) but I make an exception for these muffins. Except not really because this muffin had absolutely no orange flavour whatsoever!\n\nThis mornings word is “disappointment.”\n\nBut I can’t wait to see my friends from England again (although none of us are English…we just all met in England).\n\n(I also read somewhere that every time you recall a memory, you alter it so the memories we recall the most frequently are the ones that are the most inaccurate. I think I’m going to make it a fun game to try and recall a memory every few months or so, write it down, and see what changes about it)."

"Travel","Valparaiso","Thanks for reaching Tours 4 Tips, and for the opportunity to show you our city. The best way to get from Santiago to Valparaíso is by bus, there is no train. From where you are staying look for the closest metro station and you have to go to Pajaritos (in the red line of metro system). That station is under some repairs, so once you hope off the metro, you go out and enter the station again to purchase your bus ticket to Valparaíso, there's signs that indicate where the boxes to buy tickets are (boleterías)  and also to where the buses leave. They leave every 15 to 20 minutes and there are at least 3 companies. The bus from That station to Santiago takes around 1,5 hours to arrive to Valparaíso, as today they where no delays in the road because the fire was under control (I traveled from Santiago to Valparaíso today) is safe to assume tomorrow there will be no roads block, or problem because of the fire. \n\nOur Valparaiso Tours 4 Tips Walking Tour leaves from Plaza Sotomayor, Valparaiso's main square everyday at 10am and 3pm. Our meeting point can be found right here on Google Maps. Once reach the Bus station in Valparaíso the easiest way to find our meeting point is taking a Trolley bus, electric buss that leave close to the bus station. As you exit the main door of the bus terminal turn left along the main street where you will see taxis park in front. Walk down two blocks to the corner of Avenida Argentina and Pedro Montt and take any green and beige electric Trolley bus. The Trolley cost 250 chilean pesos (around 40 cents of USS) And will take you on a loop around the flat area of the city. You can ask the driver for ""Sotomayor"" or when you see a giant square with a huge pastel blue naval building and impressive statue in the middle you will know you are there. All you have to do is find your guide who is dressed in a red and white striped t-shirt like ""Wally"" from the childrens book ""Where’s Wally."" The tour is about 3 hours and it includes local transportation, plus many fantastic surprises. \nHope this information is useful, and you can find Wally in Valparaíso.\nIf you have any other question don't hesitate to write us,\nKind regards\nPriscilla\nA Wally guide from Valparaíso\n\n"

"Travel","Maldives","http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/worlds-best-honeymoon-destinations-for-2014#!4-maldives\n\nThe islands of the Maldives are quintessential honeymoon destinations with deserted beaches that vie for the title “most romantic spot in the world.” This archipelago of dozens of atolls and more than 1,100 coral islands span 35,000 square feet of the Indian Ocean and is located about 500 miles southwest of Sri Lanka. The Maldives are truly one of the last unspoiled island getaways in the world. \n\nIt’s hard to get there—get ready for a long-haul flight from the United States plus either a seaplane or boat transfer from the international airport—but the effort is rewarded with picture-perfect sunsets, wide beaches, and some of the best diving and snorkeling in the world. This is the place to interact with whale sharks, manta rays, reef sharks, sea turtles, and an array of colorful fish and sea creatures. Resorts are confined to their own islands so you won’t flit from place to place after you arrive. Almost all of the resorts are firmly in the “luxury” category. This is the place to book a beach villa or overwater bungalow.\n\nWhere to Stay: Every island resort is unique so you are bound to find one that fits your vacation style. Consider Per Aquum’s Huvafen Fushi with its underwater spa on the North Male Atoll or Niyama on Dhaalu Atoll. Other popular resorts include Taj Exotica Maldives known for the best cuisine in the South Male Atoll, Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru (North Male Atoll), and Angsana Valavaru (Dhaalu Atoll).\n\nPerfect for Couples Who: Love deserted island escapes. Spend your time lazing on the beach, swimming, snorkeling, diving, and enjoying Maldivian sunrises and sunsets.\n\nPhoto from Guardian article on the Maldives: http://goo.gl/jM4XQK"

"Travel","Lessons From My Time Abroad - 3/22/12","Lessons from my time abroad… The BIG overlying lesson: “I’m not afraid anymore!”\n\nIf you were born at the tail end of the 80s or in the 90s...you have seen Home Alone (1 and 2…the ones that came out in 90 and 92 starring Macaulay Culkin). One of the lines I distinctly remember is in Home Alone 1 when Kevin walks out of his house and shouts to the empty street “Hey, I'm not afraid any more! I said I'm not afraid any more! Do you hear me? I'm not afraid any more!” (and then Old Man Marley come out of nowhere and Kevin screams and runs inside and hides under the bed).\n\nYou know what line I’m talking about, children of the 90s! (If you don’t recognize or remember this line, next holiday season, I implore you to rent Home Alone).\n\nIn the almost 2.5 years I worked in the study abroad office at my Alma Mater I’ve talked to a lot of returnees and heard what they say is the biggest thing to come of their time abroad. Nine times out of ten they say it made them more outgoing. This is true for me as well, but I bet you can guess what my biggest lesson was while abroad. Learning to not be afraid anymore. Learning that fear of doing something should never hold you back from doing something you really want to do. I have one big regret and three triumphs with this.\n\nMy one big regret? Not going to Chatsworth. It was in the middle of the country, a few hours train ride in Derbyshire but no one would accompany me and I hadn’t traveled alone (except to relatively close places) by myself. Going to Chatsworth required getting on a train with transfers and using my arch enemy, the bus, to get there. I’m a master planner so it wasn’t the planning that scared me…it was the “what if things go wrong and I’m alone?” fear that paralyzed me. I’ll never know, because in the end, I didn’t go. What a great thing to miss, too.\n\nMy first triumph (and remember, this is me, the queen of worry) was going to visit an old school mate of my sister’s in Preston. It’s a little town north of where I was staying. I could even use the local rail to get there and it would take under 30 minutes to get there. Easy peasy. I’ll detail my entire trip to Preston in another post, but here’s the gist: I missed the bus and thus the train and the next train didn’t run for another hour. But I told old-school-mate that I’d meet her and her husband at the station and what time my train was coming in. I HAD to get to Preston at that time! I didn’t have her mobile to call her so she’d just be standing around for over an hour waiting for me on the next train if I didn’t! And this is where I put mind of matter and put fear behind me. I checked the bus schedule (which in reality means I stared at the bus schedule poster and hoped I was reading it right) and saw that there was bus leaving town for Preston in 20 minutes. Okay. I’ll just get on that. I don’t know how long it takes/when I’ll be arriving, where the bus station I need to get off is, or how far it is from the train station…but I got on the bus. I committed. And tried to make the best of a bad situation. I sat on the top deck (yes, England has double-decker busses everywhere!) alone, and tried to read a book for class and enjoy the ride. Just enjoy the ride. There’s nothing you can do once the bus starts moving and yeah, sure, you can panic that you’re going to miss your stop of that old-school-mate is going to be angry and not want to hang out anymore, but…like I said…once the bus is moving, you just have to throw your hands up in the air and hope for the best.\n\n(Turns out, old-school-mate had business out of town and was going to miss meeting me at the train station anyway so it all ended for the best).\n\nMy second triumph was a little trip to Formby beach (which is oddly on the same train line as Preston is). My friends and I had been up to two harbor towns: Southport, the end of the train line, and Blundelsands and Crosby before. After realizing that I wasn’t going to see Chatsworth I decided that instead of letting that fester into depression, I’d try and achieve another of my goals: to see the ocean (really the Irish Sea) one more time. I looked into train times and mapped out a walking route and everything…but never really acted. Until after my little trip to Preston. I felt good about this whole “flying solo even in the face of fear and being okay” so when I woke up the Monday of my last week in England I started packing . Packing my room and trying to wrap up all the feelings I had and pack for a last trip with my friend Hannah to Rome, the Vatican, and Germany. All morning I had this nagging feeling in my stomach...today or tomorrow would be my last chance to go to the beach. And about 10 minutes later I decided to stop thinking about it and take action. I quickly checked some train times, packed my bag, and walked to the bus stop. Another long story short: I made it to the beach. It wasn’t nearly as straight shot as Formby (you can easily see the beach from the road but in Formby you have to climb over their famous dunes! And walk a bit before you hit the beach) but I made it. Sure, I got\n\nlost on the way back and started to panic a bit because it was getting dark, but I had my music, a mobile, and the knowledge that the eventually I’d make it back. I had to.\n\nThose were probably the longest and most boring anecdotes you’ve ever read so I’ll just wrap it up. Yes, there are healthy fears in life. But if you have a fear that’s holding you back from doing something completely extraordinary and life changing…work on overcoming it. That’s the funny thing about fear…the more fear you have, the more it requires to overcome it…but when you do, it’s an even greater victory. There’s such a thrill in going to the edge and coming back. (You should know that I am 100% NOT an adrenaline junkie and am not referring to overcoming fear of sticking your hand in an alligator’s mouth).\n\nHere it is in one sentence:\n\nI’m telling you…don’t be afraid…and even when you are afraid…keep calm and carry on.\n\nI’ll leave you with another video and some lyrics from One Republic. Ryan Tedder brilliantly sang “When we were children we’d play out in the streets just tempting fate…when we were children we’d say that we don’t know the meaning of fear…wish I didn’t know the meaning of…”\n\nSo, you’re asking yourself…”if I’ve already divulged the big one, what other lessons could you possibly tell me that will be interesting and informative?” Worry not, dear reader.

"Travel","Travel to Marseilles via train in UK","Travel to Marseilles via train \n \n \nThe Times (London)  \nJune 9, 2001, Saturday  \nSECTION: Features  \n \nLENGTH: 678 words  \n \nHEADLINE: The new Marseilles connection  \n \nBYLINE: Steve Keenan  \n \nBODY:  \n \n \nThe French know how to run a railway and, from tomorrow, the trains will run even faster when a high-speed line opens to the Mediterranean. Steve Keenan made a break for the coast and found out what to do once you reach France's second city  \n \nBy NOW our exhausted politicians probably need a break. Can I suggest a soothing trip on French railways? While our elected representatives have huffed and puffed about the state of the trains, the French have been quietly and efficiently adding another very impressive spoke to their rail network.  \n \nTomorrow, a new high-speed line opens be- tween Valence and Marseilles. It will cut journey times from Waterloo to the Med (with an easy change at Lille) to little more than six hours -that's about the time it takes to reach the Lake District from the capital. With two changes.  \n \nAnd, with all respect to Keswick, Marseilles makes for a pretty spectacular end of the line.  \n \nThe southern capital has emerged as one of the country's sexiest cities, voted France's favourite by the under-25s. It has beaches, the best bouillabaisse in the nation and the biggest yacht harbour in Europe. Taxi 2, a cult film shot locally, became the biggest hit in France last year, putting a new celluloid complexion on the face of Marseilles -many will better remember the city as the location for The French Connection, Gene Hackman's drug-busting cop classic, The new line is the biggest development for SNCF French Railways in six years, and the company is making a big fuss about it. More than 40 TGV trains are being refurbished and the number running from Lille to Marseilles is doubling to eight a day. The aim is to boost passengers on the route by one-third, to 23 million a year -and it is looking to the UK to provide a large chunk of extra business.  \n \nBut the opening of the line is also timely for Marseilles and the other cities en route: Lyons, Valence, Avignon and Aix-en-Provence. Rail travel on the Continent is growing fast in popularity with British holidaymakers, and French Railways is among the operators to have recently launched rail-based short-break holidays.  \n \nHere in the UK, we still get sentimental about steam trains and hark back to a golden age of rail -but we relish doing train travel for real across the Channel. While Railtrack struggles to mend tracks, the French build new ones. It's electrifying.  \n \nAnd, unlike the stress of air travel, it is incredibly soothing. Two weekends ago, I took the ""old"" TGV line, dawdling at a mere 120mph, to the Med. Leaving London at 9am, I was settled aboard the TGV at Lille shortly after midday, local time.  \n \nThe line wound through Burgundy as I sipped a, well, Burgundy. Sun streamed through the windows of the buffet bar. The loos were clean. Bless the French, there is even a smoking carriage.  \n \nAvoiding the cities, the deserted countryside rolled past. I remembered overnight coach trips as a teenager to campsites on the Cote d'Azur and shuddered. Running parallel to the road, cars travelled backwards as we surged past heading south to the sun. The temperature rose one degree centigrade every 30 minutes.  \n \nThe line joins the Rhone Valley just north of Lyons. South of Valence the landscape gets denser, closer. To the left, the foothills of the Alps glistened. It is from Valence that the new 150-mile track runs over a new viaduct at Avignon to Marseilles, which cuts an hour off the journey from the Channel.  \n \nThe view became more industrial and the graffiti more common as the valley narrowed until, quite unexpectedly, just past the petrochemical plant, a shimmering lagoon that feeds into the Mediterranean appeared on the right.  \n \nOne of the last sights, before the islands off Marseilles hoved into view, was the airport. French Railways believes the new line will immediately knock out a quarter of Air France's Mediterranean business. Looking out over the crowded motorways and pondering the Pounds 25 cab fare from the airport to the city centre, I'm surprised it's not more.  \n \nWhat to do once you're there: page 2  \n \nThe Times (London)  \nJune 9, 2001, Saturday  \nSECTION: Features  \n \nLENGTH: 1088 words  \n \nHEADLINE: Port in a storming location  \n \nBYLINE: Steve Keenan  \n \nBODY:  \n \n \nSteve Keenan finds the quay to a good time in Marseilles  \n \nFIFTEEN minutes after getting off the train, I was looking out from my hotel room over the myriad bobbing yachts in busy Marseilles harbour.  \n \nIt was an easy, downhill walk from the station to the hotel. And it was just as easy to dump the bag and slip downstairs for an early evening pastis in one of the dozens of back-to-back bars lining the three sides of the harbour.  \n \nMarseilles has the biggest yacht harbour in Europe, with some 3,000 berths in the main basin alone, creating a constantly shifting backdrop. This is not a Monaco or St Tropez, where gin palaces stay moored to the dockside for the season -this is very much a working harbour.  \n \nFishing boats tie up every morning to flog fish -marlin, squid and shellfish - to stallholders on the quayside. A ferry criss-crosses mid-harbour every few minutes, saving an 800-yard walk around the quays. Frequent ferries take tourists to the outlying islands. And all jostle for space with ocean-going yachts.  \n \nThe bustle on the quayside is equally competitive. The day's catch is being prepared for that night's bouillabaisse and shrieking seagulls hover over the quayside waiting to snatch a fish head when the market finishes at 1pm.  \n \nThe harbour is the natural focal point of Marseilles. The streets rise on all sides away from sea-level and everything you are likely to want to see over a weekend is within 15 minutes' walk of the water.  \n \nFrom one side of the harbour, it is 500ft up steep, winding streets to Notre Dame de la Garde for a panoramic perspective of the city (tip: the number 60 bus from the quayside also goes there).  \n \nFrom the other, it is less of a hike into Marseilles' oldest district, the Panier, whose centre is the Vielle Charite, a former 17th-century poorhouse saved by Le Corbusier and now an arts centre. Have a coffee in the lovely courtyard.  \n \nI don't think I've ever come across a city that is so easy to work out and so accessible. You climb a hill, root around a bit, then head back down to the harbour.  \n \nSaturday should be spent shopping around Rue St Farreol (which includes Galeries Lafayette), Rue Paradis and Rue de Rome because on Sunday, everything -bar the restaurants and bars -is shut, even the bureaux de change. At Cours Julien, a bohemian area where the graffiti is interspersed with individualistic shops and restaurants, only a Moroccan cafe and a brasserie were open. Mind you, given the packed tables under the trees, it was a pleasant spot for lunch. The same is true of Place Thiars, which has a choice of good dining spots.  \n \nEven the occasional hawker didn't make much effort to disturb lunch. But it was 34C.  \n \nSo make Sunday the day for sightseeing -or the beach. The number 83 bus from the harbour will be packed but the 30-minute journey to the Prado beach is an institution for many. Home-grown hero Eric Cantona says: ""Marseilles is a little like Rio. We have the sun, we have beaches -it is a large, cosmopolitan city.""  \n \nIt is also very affordable, with a harbourside hotel costing Pounds 50 a double room, French railways offering Pounds 95 special return fares, and meals costing, on average, just Pounds 10. You can get away with Pounds 250 a head for the weekend -Pounds 300 if you go for the bouillabaisse. Which you should.  \n \nNEED TO KNOW  \n \nGetting there: Steve Keenan travelled with Rail Europe and the French Tourist Board.  \n \nRail Europe (0870-584 8848, www.raileurope.co.uk <http://www.raileurope.co.uk>) has introductory fares from Waterloo to Marseilles of Pounds 95 return (Pounds 145 in first class) for travel by August 12. You must book seven days in advance and stay either a Saturday night or two nights.  \n \nA sample itinerary could be the 8.53am Eurostar on Friday to Lille (9.27am from Ashford), connecting with the 12.17pm TGV to Marseilles, arriving 4.46pm. The return 1.52pm to Lille on Sunday connects with the 7.36pm Eurostar, arriving Waterloo at 8.39pm (Ashford 7.38pm).  \n \nAlternatively, low-cost airline buzz (0870-240 7070, www.buzzaway.com <http://www.buzzaway.com>) has daily flights from Stansted to Marseilles from Pounds 50 one way.  \n \nWhere to stay: La Residence du Vieux Port, 18 Quai du Port (00 33 4 91 91 91 22) has 40 splendid rooms (Pounds 60 a double), all with views over the harbour. Other recommended hotels on the front include the Mercure, 4 Rue Beauvau (020-8283 4580) for Pounds 95 and the New Hotel Vieux Port, 3 Rue Reine Elisabeth (00 33 4 91 99 23 23) for Pounds 45.  \n \nWhere to eat: For the best bouillabaisse, eat at La Miramar, 12 Quai du Port (91 91 10 40): Pounds 30 a head; Le Tire Bouchon, 11 Cours Julien (91 42 49 03) for Lyonnaise food, Pounds 10; La Poudriere, 36 Cours Julien is a trendy cafe in a comic book shop. There are plenty of Italian restaurants around Place Thiars with set menus averaging Pounds 10.  \n \nA quick drink: La Caravelle, 34 Quai du Port (91 90 36 64) is the best spot in town -live jazz on Friday and Saturday. Otherwise, any bar on the quay, including Bar de la Marine, 15 Quai de Rive Neuve, an old haunt of Marcel Pagnol, author of Jean de Florette.  \n \nClubbing: In town, Le Trolley Bus, 24 Quai de Rive Neuve (91 54 30 45) and Le Metal Cafe, 20 Rue Fortia (91 54 03 03) are rated as class acts. On the beach, try La Plage, 91 Promenade de la Plage (91 71 59 13) and the open-air dancefloor at La Maronaise, Anse Croisette (91 73 25 21).  \n \nWhat's on: There are 14 museums: for listings, contact the Office of Culture at 42 La Canabiere (96 11 04 60). Forthcoming events include an exhibition by the disturbing French artist Gilles Barbier, from June 29 to September 30, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, 69 Avenue d'Haifa (91 25 01 07).  \n \nThe Marseilles Festival (91 99 02 50, www.festivaldemarseille <http://www.festivaldemarseille>.com) runs June 28-July 25. All sorts of dance, theatre and cinema: the festival kicks off with a hip-hop version of Carmen. Honestly.  \n \nJazz from Five Continents is held July 23-28 at Le Palais Longchamp (96 11 04 60).  \n \nExcursions: Try a half-day sea kayaking for Pounds 15 with Raskas Kayak (91 73 18 33) or a day's diving. Contact Plongez Marseilles (91 72 32 53).  \n \nThe resort of L'Estaque has been immortalised by impressionist and cubist painters, including Braque and Cezanne. Take the number 35 bus from the town hall.  \n \nFurther information: French Tourist Office (0906-824 4123, 60p a minute). The English-speaking Marseilles Tourist Office, 4 La Canabiere (00 33 4 91 13 89 00, www.marseille-tourisme.com <http://www.marseille-tourisme.com>) has an excellent choice of guided walks and taxi tours.  \n \n \n \n"

The broth is generally a\nmix of pork, chicken, seafood, and vegetables, with each shop crafting\ntheir own blend. Most mix various parts of pig and fowl, some add more\ncomplex elements, and some never reveal their secrets. Though most diners\ncategorize ramen into shoyu, miso, shio, and tonkotsu types, many shops\nspecialize in just one style, referred to simply as ""ramen"" on their menu.\nThis guide details the basic characteristics of a number of established\nregional styles; it only scratches the surface of the myriad varieties of\nramen being served every day across Japan.\n <http://luckypeach.com/a-guide-to-the-regional-ramen-of-japan/>     [image:\nZite logo] <http://zite.com/>\n\nAvailable on the App Store\n<http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=419752338&mt=8>\n.\n\n\nSent from my iPad\n\n\n\n-- \nDarko Butorac\n\nMusic Director\n\nMissoula Symphony Association\nTallahassee Symphony Orchestra\n\nwww.darkobutorac.com\nwww.tallahasseesymphony.org\nwww.missoulasymphony.org\n[image: FB Like]Missoula Symphony<\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Missoula-Symphony/27236022861?ref=hl>\n"

Gorge Avon hotel for afternoon tea �. \nZizi's for dinner and the milk thistle (prohibition bar) for yummy cocktails (milk thistle daisy and yak attack)\nTrain back up to Filton abbey, walk to holiday inn. Decide to climb over the rails. Louise falls and is hanging like they're monkey bars- Chris comes to the rescue �\n\nSaturday - bath. Bath abbey, cool shops ( cheese shop with the yummy bath soft cheese, bath glass with no seal ornaments). Roman baths / museum - had a glass of the hot sprint water and we are now healed of everything �. \nWalk around the park and a look at the market with a cool tea/coffee bean shop. \nThermae bath spa- queued for over an hour - crazy but worth it. Tried out the saunas ( lemongrass and ginger was the best one) then down to the Minerva pool for a swim and a float, up to the rooftop pool (only hot spring in the UK). Stupidly dropped in my glasses!!!! Girl: oh no someone dropped their glasses. Louise:*touches her head* oh shit they're mine!! Haha\nWent back down for a final blast of the lemongrass and ginger sauna �. \nShower and get ready- Louise puts gown back on- back up to the lockers- oh shit where's my wrist band. Makes guy get the master key and open the locker. Go to the changing room, remove robe and guess what she finds- her blooming band!! Idiot! \nFinished the evening with a chimichanga \n\nSunday: lazy morning. Go to Bristol and saw two banksy graffiti art along frogmore street. Walked up to the docks and took an 80p ferry to take us across the rivr and took a look at the ss Bristol ship. Louise leaves iPhone in toilet - plonker. \nAnother look at the ship and the gift shop and we walk along the harbour. Went to St Nicholas market but it was closed �. Went to a hot pot instead - simply delicious! \nHad another walk around with my extra few pounds gained and looked at the shops before heading back to the car.\n\nLovely weekend trip away !! ��� xoxoxo  "

You’d now have space in your life for other things: exercise, reading, meditation, cooking healthy food, cuddling with loved ones.\n>> \n>> Instead of working from the minute you wake up until you’re going to bed, what if you only worked six hours a day? Or four hours? That would be dependent on what kind of job you have, of course, but in this hypothetical situation, you’d probably use that limited time better, with more focus, and get your important tasks done first. And you’d be better rested and therefore have better focus and energy when you did work.\n>> \n>> Instead of eating as much as you can, what if you only ate during certain predefined times? For example, if you only ate between 12-1 p.m. and 6-8 p.m., you’d probably eat less. Or what if you only could eat whole foods, nothing pre-prepared or with sugar, white flour, or weird chemical names? You’d eat less and your health would improve.\n>> \n>> Instead of being able to buy things all the time, what if you could only buy things (other than groceries and toiletries) on the 1st of every month? You’d probably buy less, and your debt would decrease and savings and investments would increase.\n>> \n>> What if you could only do 3 tasks a day (besides responding to emails)? You’d pick the important tasks.\n>> \n>> What if you could only sit for a total of two hours a day? You’d move around more, do some work standing up, drop some of your back problems, and lose some weight.\n>> \n>> These limits, of course, are only arbitrary. It would take some experimenting to figure out what would work best for you. But you can see in these examples that limits can be powerful, because they force us to choose, to focus, to go from excess to healthy moderation.\n>> \n>>  <http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/zenhabits?a=aur9QCLC_yQ:RHMM_-fZiNU:yIl2AUoC8zA>  <http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/zenhabits?a=aur9QCLC_yQ:RHMM_-fZiNU:F7zBnMyn0Lo>  <http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/zenhabits?a=aur9QCLC_yQ:RHMM_-fZiNU:V_sGLiPBpWU>\n>> You are subscribed to email updates from zen habits <http://zenhabits.net/> \n>> To stop receiving these emails, you may unsubscribe now <https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailunsubscribe?k=Dh7Zf0H2de_I0yRd8oI5jMVm-ls>.

"Travel","Why I Travel - 3/2513","The majority of people probably have at least one of these thoughts on travel deep down inside of them: \n\n1) ""I would love to go to ______ and see _______. BUT _______.""\n2) ""People who constantly travel, who can't settle down in one place...they must have SERIOUS committment issues.""\n\n""Yeah, but..."" statements kill me. ""Yeah, but I can't afford it, I don't have the time, no one will go with me."" Let's get real. If there's a ""yeah, but..."" attached to something, you're not trying hard enough to find a solution. Travel is something most would like to do but it falls so low on their priority list. Why is that? (That's a legitamite question, you can email me an answer to). Travel isn't just for history buffs or hopeless wanderers...so what's stopping everyone? \n\nWhich brings me the second statement and a minor confession: I think about this a lot because it has the ability to affect my relationships. It's true, I get antsy when I don't travel every few weeks, months, etc. Does that mean I don't have a home of my own and recurring bills and friends that like to see me? Absolutely not. I'm the BIGGEST homebody when I'm not traveling. I'd love nothing more than to just spend the weekend on my couch with takeout, some friends, and a bunch of movies. There is usually no greater joy than seeing someone at the airport to pick you up from your latest adventure to take you home. I love home, okay? \n\nIf traveling isn't your fulltime job though then you have to find a balance between the two. Bills still need to get paid. Life still needs to go on. Most people need some stability in their lives and that's that. But there are some people in the world who will say ""Yes. I know you have bills to pay. But if traveling is your passion, even if I don't understand why, I encourage you to do it."" And even fewer people will say ""Have a good time! And if you're looking for some company along the way, I'll go with you."" \n\nI can count on one hand the number of people in my life who would fall into the latter category because, going back to statement one, travel scares people. People qualify it and justify not traveling with so many reasons. Sure, it can be your thing but not theirs. But with any passion of yours in life, make it a point to surround yourself only with people who don't need you to explain yourself (as I have tried to here). \n\nPeople probably stand on the outside of my life feeling sad for me because I don't have these deep, meaningful realtionships like they think all people need but in reality, I'm perfectly content! And if in 5 or 10 years or even next year I decide to retire my passport and settle down into a house with a white picket fence, fine. But for now I'd much rather have a travel companion to watch my bags in the airport while I run to the loo or to exchange stories with on a long train ride. Those are the important realtionships I value most. Those friends provide my balance. \n\nHave a great week, all. \n\nxx"

"Travel","Scotland: Check train tickets etc. and book restaurants for at least one night. Ideas:","Lorna: Hmm that would be Islay I think for the inn near the distillery . I think it might be this one we actually stayed in the bowmore distillery cottages , we did the gardeners’ one \n\nhttp://www.harbour-inn.com/\n\nhttps://cottages.bowmore.co.uk/\nhowever for the first island visit go to Skye its an easier journey too you can fly to Inverness  from London and hire a car then its only about  2 hours drive (my niece does that).\nRe  places to eat for seafood try the 3 chimneys . I think there is a great seafood place on the harbour side at portree although I’ve not been in it . \nI can however recommend red skye  at lower breakish . I’ve eaten there a few times in the presence of seafood and meat eaters and it looks superb (as is the veggie option) it was an old school apparently \nhttp://www.redskyerestaurant.co.uk/\n\nThings to do on skye \n1)	Elgol and take a boat to loch coruisk (the road is a beast to allow at least double if not triple the time you need) its 12 miles from broadford and will take the best part of an hour as you will be stopping to admire the view . Elgol is magnificent \n2)	Dunvegan castle very interesting and take the seal boat trip from the wee harbour behind the castle its amazing being in the middle of a seal colony like that .\n3)	If wildlife is your deal think about the sea eagle boat trip (operator mv stardust) take the first one in the morning . if you are going in June you may see dolphins we did I got so excited I forgot to use my camera ......\n4)	Re walks there are more than you can shake a stick at but I do love the one to the old man of storr \n5)	If you fancy distilleries visit the talisker one , the booze is nice too  you can also go to tallisker beach although the road is nasty it’s worth the angst to get there \n\n_____________________________________________________\nif you do mull then there is an epic sea eagle thing to do there and we have discovered quite a nice hotel as we are going to have an overnight there to do the sea eagle boat trip sometime this summer  \n\nhttp://www.mullcharters.com/popular.html\nhttp://www.thebellachroy.co.uk/\n\nim also told that you can see a lot of otters on mull \nhttp://www.isle-of-mull.net/attractions/wildlife/otters/\n\noh and if you go to mull why not take the boat across to iona its literally only minutes . ive never been but apparently its rather amazing \n\nhttp://www.welcometoiona.com/\n\ni thought it would be full of god botherers but apparently that’s not the case and its beautiful \nhttp://www.isle-of-iona.net/\n\nyou could do arran of course and a certain mr Hallan is a one man arran tourist board  The late mrs Hallan came from there and he is over a lot  he recommends the douglas hotel in brodick \n\noh and if you are doing mull and skye stop over at the bridge of orchy hotel or the invergarry hotel on the way to skye \n\nhttp://www.invergarryhotel.co.uk/\nhttp://www.bridgeoforchy.co.uk/\n\nive stayed at the bridge of orchy a lot in winter it makes photographing dawn on the moor more humane when you are not doing a 2 hour drive in the dark on ice roads .

Prior to joining Yieldify approximately 8-9 months ago, I completed a PhD in Bioinformatics and population genetics from Imperial College London. Following on from this I pursued post-doctoral training at Imperial, where I undertook projects involving a significant element of complex mathematical modelling of dynamical systems and statistical inference. In particular my skill set includes a significant amount of research using Bayesian inference, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and particle MCMC methods. Since moving to Yieldify, I have initiated a large and varied number of data science projects, including the creation of suite of A/B testing tools and most recently the application of the multi-armed bandit algorithm under the framework of Bayesian optimisation. In addition, I have also used a number of machine learning algorithms for classification and prediction, such as k-means, random forests and generalised linear models such as logistic regression. I am eager to continue learning new computational and quantitative methods to add to add to the varied skill set that I possess. In particular, I am very interested in positions, which provide an opportunity to harness deep learning methods,\nwhich coupled with complex data sets are revealing remarkable insights. I am a strong communicator, priding myself on my ability to describe complex problems to technical and non-technical colleagues alike. "

"Travel","Preston - 2/12/12","We've spent a lot of time on trains/buses/planes (I have th ticket stubs to prove it). But they say it's all about the journey. And journey we did. From one coast (Crosby) to the other (Edinburgh). Time spen on trains consisted of chatting, sleeping, listening to music reading, or working on Uni work. And almost always, the cross country trains involved a lot of eating. \n\nI can pick out many memorable train rides, like the one from Manchester with the drunk lady who tossed her cookies at midnight after the yellowcard concert, or the one home from Bath where I sat across from a cute guy studying medicine (on the same journey we learned the pitfalls of not reserving a seat...read: we stood for over an hour and a half combined on an almost 8 hour trip there and back). \nOne of my favourite trips, though, was to Preston (Dec 10) to visit one of my sister's old school friends. In my mind, traveling alone is bliss because you can eat where and when you want, you can rest when you want, and you can sit where you like on the train and enjoy the peace and quiet of your own mind. The downside of traveling alone is panicing alone. When something goes wrong (which doesn't normally...strike that...EVER...happen when I'm planning because I plan so thoroughly), you're a lone.\nCue preston. \nI was supposed to take the _____ train and meet Ashley and her husband at the train station in Preston. I can't remember when held me up, if it was dressing or what, but I got to the bus stop apparently just AFTER the bus left, so I was going to have to wait 15 mins for the next bus. The minutes ticked by and with 10 minutes to go before the train left, I knew i was going to miss it (although I did contenplate for a good 5 minutes whether I should run to town and skip the bus...but I'd already spent so much time waiting for the bus, I was going to take it, damn it!) I went from tapping my foot to pacing...strike that...stomping, back and forth. I didn't have Ashley's mobile to tell her I was going to be late either...Imagine the most horible feeling you've felt in your whole life...double it...double that...and that's how I felt. I considered going back to my room to check more train times but hell hath no fury like an Asian girl who has missed her train so I took the bus to town, walked to the train station (in the rain), and checked the time boards in person. And then I did something brave.\nI walked back to the bus station and checked times for the Preston bus. It departed a few minutes before the train so I decided to take the bus (which turned out to be a bad move because even though the bus left earlier, it took more time! I should've waited for the train...) I had some time to kill and i wasn't about to walk back to campus so I walked through the market (it was a Saturday) and checked to see if any of the local shops had wifi...which was a bust...so I walked to McDonalds....ordered a chicken wrap and fries...and messaged Ashley on FB telling her I'd missed the train but was going to take the bus. \n\nMunch munch.\n\nI got back to the bus stop in time to double check the schedule, and chat with the driver (to make sure Preston was the last stop). Bought an all day ticket and headed to the top deck. For a front of the bus window seat! Win. I had a book with me that I started to read but the whole time I was on the bus I kept thinking...when am I going to know to get off? What if the bus passes my stop? (little did I know, last stop meant the bus pulls into a station, actually pulls into a spot, and sits for a bit). I went betwen wrtinging my hands in agony over missing the train, reading my book for CB, and looking out the window at all the route the bus was taking. \n\nThe bus ride there turned out to be one of the best experiences I had in England. The SUN came out (which is so rare in England) and even though the bus took longer to get to Preston, my front row seat on the top deck was like watching a movie where the camera pans over the land. It was beautiful! I saw many towns along the way, beautiful fields...just a quiet peaceful England...exactly what I love about England. Undisturbed. The roads so narrow that cars have to pull to one side when a another car is coming down the road. Many time our drive would pull over to let some cars by...you'd never see bus drivers in the US doing that! They have schedules to keep!"

Locals say that when a foreigner discovered this valley in the northernmost part of Luzon many moons ago, the people here were still living in loincloths, so he likened the area to be Filipino Eden. Hence the area was called ""Adan"" and an ajoining area ""Eba"" (Adam and Eve). And the association to Eden comes as no surprise. It's rustic. It's surrounded by stunning natural scenery. There are no buffets. No jeepneys. No souvenir shops, No commercial hotels. No fast food culture. Authenticity is the new luxury and Adams is the Gucci of PH ecotourism. I highly recommend Adams for any adventurous traveller looking for privacy, clean air and water, fresh food, charming locals, and strong wifi. Stay at Beruna Cottage. My only choice. Look up Beruna Cottage yourself on Facebook. I'm not going to make it easy for you. You gotta work a little bit to get here. ‪#‎berunacottage‬ ‪#‎IlocosNorte‬ ‪#‎Adams‬"

In the latter many security analysts question NK attribution based on the similarity of code argument given by the US -- pointing out that the code base was in the wild for a long time, could be purchased on black market or reverse/reengineered after picking up the malware from a vulnerable machine.\nShouldn't we also assume that this malware, having been in the wild for ""10 years"", could have simply been modified and thrown into the NSA tool chest? When applying the same level of scepticism from the Sony hack, nothing in this article represents real proof to counter relevant arguments against US attribution.\nRegardless, the Spiegel assumptions or slant is worthy if for nothing else than to teach everyone the issues with attribution, whether applied to greater or lesser evils.\nreply \nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8952684"

"Travel","How to Buy Happiness: The Purchases Most Likely to Bring You Joy","How to Buy Happiness: The Purchases Most Likely to Bring You Joy - http://pulse.me/s/3kDnKq \n\nSome purchased items can make you happy, yes, but you've probably heard that the best use of money is buying experiences instead. Our life is built around our experiences and the memory of a great vacation will stick with us a lot longer than a new smartphone. Experiences also have the perk of shaping who you are. You could learn a lot about yourself—and what you really want in life—when you opt for an awesome experience instead of a new TV that would just keep you glued to your couch. \n\nSo if you want an easy boost to your happiness, you need to get out in the world and do some new things. But you don't have to do it alone! In fact, it might even be better for you to buy experiences with others. Being social makes us happy, and investing in experiences that you can talk about later with others is a great way to do that. You get the benefits of a new experience, as well as the perks of feeling like you were involved in something special later on. Think of something of you've always wanted to do and get some friends or family involved. If you can, plan multiple things far ahead, so you can build the anticipation (which can help you enjoy it even more).\n\nAbundance is the enemy of appreciation, \n\nIt may not seem like it some days, but time is even more limited than money. If that's the case for you, you can take the money you already have and buy more time in a couple different ways. For example, our own Adam Pash found that he was much happier after hiring a house cleaner. It freed up his time and he didn't have to argue about cleanliness with his wife. Imagine what you could do with the amount time you spend cleaning now \n\nas you make more money, avoid spending more money. This is called ""lifestyle inflation"", and it can make it seem like you never got a raise to begin with. Spending more money on the things you used to spend less on won't make you any happier. Remember the things that made you happy before your bump in earnings and tell yourself that it doesn't have to change.\n\nhappiness is not a place you reach and rest at. Instead, imagine it like a garden, as it takes constant upkeep and care. As soon as you stop watering and pulling weeds, it can go away. So while it may be true that money can't make you perpetually happy, it can certainly be a quick watering that your plants so desperately need every now and again."

On a nice day, the views are breathtaking, and more and more attractions are popping up along the thoroughfare’s piers, including the recently relocated Exploratorium\nDragon Gate on the intersection of Grand and Bush Street is the iconic entrance to San Francisco's Chinatown\nTelegraph hill\nFerry building for food\nPlan ahead of time and make a reservation at Bourbon and Branch. (You’ll need a password to get in, so don’t even think about showing up without one.) The speakeasy has been around since prohibition was for real, and their sophisticated drink menu has something for everyone. \nWalk along the Embarcadero, from the Ferry Building and turn around just shy of Fisherman’s Wharf. (Nothing good is in Fisherman’s Wharf.) Even better, rent a cheap bike from the Bike Man (whose hut is just under the Bay Bridge) and cycle along the Embarcadero, and go all the way up to Crissy Field to see the Golden Gate Bridge\nThe historic Sutro Baths, a former public bathhouse, and the surrounding parklands of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, is a beautiful place to hike near Ocean Beach\nMission Dolores Park for city views\n\n////////////////////////////////////////\nVancouver:\n\nBOLT BUS - April\n\nhttp://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g154943-i81-k5528396-1_Day_Visit_in_Vancouver-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html\n\nhttp://www.timeout.com/vancouver/features/318/20-great-things-to-do-in-vancouver\n\nhttp://www.lonelyplanet.com/canada/travel-tips-and-articles/34634\n\n		Downtown Core  This includes the main business core,  Stanley Park , the West End, Yaletown, Chinatown, Robson Street and the cruise ship pier of Canada Place.  Luckily, the downtown core with itsshopping, restaurants and nearby attractions are very walkable.    The Walk Vancouver website provides suggested walking itineraries with descriptions, maps and photos.   Tired of walking?  A popular option is to use a hop on/hop off bus tour.  The Vancouver Trolley Company has stops at most of the major tourist must-sees and for one price, you can do a loop around the city, get off at any stop, stay as long as you like, and get back on the next trolley.   Taxis are another quick and relatively cheap way to get to a restaurant or nightspot in the evening.  For more detailed information about taxis, see the article Vancouver: Taxi and Rental Cars.\n		\nhttp://www.vancouvertrolley.com/"

"Travel","Chicago","http://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/illinois/chicago/ \nTOP REASONS TO GO:\nARCHITECTURE The skyline dazzles with some of the country's most iconic buildings.\nLOCAL EATS Cheap ethnic bites and gourmet chefs make Chicago a great food town.\nART See everything from old masters at the Art Institute to outdoor sculptures in Millennium Park.\nJAZZ AND BLUES Music venues are filled with both big-name legends and up-and-comers.\nSHOPPING Stop at designer shops on the Magnificent Mile or funky Wicker Park boutiques.\nCOMEDY Chicago improv venues are well-known training grounds for comedy superstars.\n\nWHEN TO GO\n\nJune, September, and October are mild and sunny. November through March the temperature ranges from crisp to bitter, April and May can fluctuate between cold/soggy and bright/warm, and July and August can either be perfect or serve up the deadly combo of high heat and high humidity. That said, the only thing certain about Chicago's weather, according to locals, is that it can change in an instant. If you head to Chicago in warmer months, you'll be able to catch some of the fantastic outdoor festivals; during the holiday season the city's decked out in lights.\n\nTop experiences\nhttp://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/illinois/chicago/experiences/\n\nNeighborhoods\nhttp://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/illinois/chicago/neighborhoods/\n\nPlopping etc\nENJOY THE LAKE\nSan Diego and Los Angeles may have the ocean, and New York its Central Park, but Chicago has the peaceful waters of Lake Michigan at its doorstep. Bikers, dog walkers, boaters, and runners crowd the lakefront paths on warm days; in winter the lake is equally beautiful, with icy towers formed from frozen sheets of water.\n\nHIT THE BEACH\nOne of the greatest surprises in the city is the miles of sandy beaches that Chicagoans flock to in summer. The water becomes warm enough to swim in toward the end of June, though the brave will take an icy dip through the end of October. Chicago has about 30 miles of shoreline, most of it sand or rock beach. Beaches are open to the public daily from 11 am (a handful at 9:30 am) to 7 pm, Memorial Day through Labor Day, and many beaches have changing facilities; all are wheelchair-accessible.\n\nThe Chicago Park District (312/742–7529 www.chicagoparkdistrict.com) provides lifeguard protection during daylight hours throughout the swimming season.\n\nAll references to north and south in beach listings refer to how far north or south of the Loop each beach is. In other words, 1600 to 2400 North means the beach begins 16 blocks north of the Loop (at Madison Street, which is the 100 block) and extends for eight blocks.\n\nAlong the lakefront you'll see plenty of broken-rock breakwaters with signs that warn ""No swimming or diving."" Although Chicagoans frequently ignore these signs, you shouldn't. The boulders below the water are slippery with seaweed and may hide sharp, rusty scraps of metal, and the water beyond is very deep. It can be dangerous even if you know the territory.\n\nBOATING\nNothing beats the view of the Chicago skyline from the water, especially when the sun sets behind the sparkling skyscrapers. Plenty of boats are available to rent or charter, though you might want to leave the skippering to others if you're not familiar with Great Lakes navigation.\n\nSailboat lessons, rentals, and charters are available from Chicago Sailing (Belmont Harbor, Lakeview 773/871–7245 www.chicagosailing.com). Chicago Sailing focuses on sailing instruction for all levels and includes a program on keeping your boat in tip-top shape.\n\nSailboats, Inc. (Monroe Harbor, Loop 800/826–7010 www.sailboats-inc.com), one of the oldest charter-certification schools in the country, prepares its students to charter any type of boat."

Long drive but apparently it's crazy beautiful trip. Puddle jump plane ride is also an option \nStay 2-3 days in Denali-- crazy beautiful national park, see mount McKinley etc\n \nhttp://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g143022-Activities-Denali_National_Park_and_Preserve_Alaska.html\n \nDrive back to anchorage (4.5 hours) \n \nAgain I am available to leave starting Wednesday or Thursday July 22/23. Nell cannot leave till that Saturday. One option is to leave from Montreal. I may actually go on a trip to Montreal the week before that so it might work well for me \n\nAlaskan Dream Cruises \nWho: Now in its second season, Alaskan Dream Cruises started running multi-night, expedition-style cruises after company owner David Allen, of the established boat-building firm Allen Marine, acquired several Cruise West vessels in late 2010. The company, which is well established in Alaska and had long offered whale-watching day trips out of Juneau, Ketchikan and Sitka, specializes in voyages that have a strong cultural component. (The Allen family are members of the Tlingit Kaagwaantaan Clan). \nShips: Alaskan Dream, formerly the Executive Explorer catamaran owned by Majestic America and Glacier Bay cruise lines, carries 42 passengers. Admiralty Dream, formerly Spirit of Columbia from Cruise West, has cabins for 66 people. Each ship has lounges for happy hours, as well as post-dinner lectures and programs. \n\nItineraries: The Sitka-based line offers seven itineraries. Ports of call include the larger cities of Ketchikan, Skagway and Haines, as well as Thorne Bay, Kasaan, Wrangell, Gustavus and Glacier Bay. Town stops include historical walking tours and cultural performances, while nature stops offer hiking and wildlife-viewing. Another unique offering is a day of activities with ATV's, sea kayaks and small power boats at the company's private ""Adventure Base Camp"" in Hobart Bay. \n\nWeb Site: www.alaskandreamcruises.com \n\nAmerican Safari Cruises/InnerSea Discoveries \n\nWho: Headquartered in Seattle and run by Cruise West veterans Dan Blanchard and Tim Jacox, American Safari Cruises and its sister line, InnerSea Discoveries, have been the most aggressive in claiming the Alaska small-ship market by sending six ships into the area for the 2012 season. While it launched InnerSea Discoveries as an expedition line in 2011, the company is starting to unite all of its vessels under ""The UnCruise"" mantle (trying to appeal to people who might not normally cruise). The larger ships in the line feature built-in docks for kayaks and standup paddleboards, while the smaller yacht-style ships include drinks and a spa treatment in the fare. \n\nShips: Under the InnerSea Discoveries expedition-style label, the line has three ships. Seventy-six-passenger Wilderness Discoverer and 60-passenger Wilderness Adventurer both launched in 2011, enjoying sold-out seasons. In 2012, Wilderness Explorer, formerly owned by Cruise West as the Spirit of Discovery, joined the expedition fleet after extensive renovations that included cutting the number of passengers from 86 to 76. All ships have kayaks, standup paddleboards and hot tubs onboard. \n\nAn April 2012, fire consumed the smallest American Safari Cruises vessel, Safari Spirit, leaving the division with three ships. The newest, Safari Endeavour, is a renovation of Cruise West's Spirit of Endeavour and is the largest under the ASC umbrella, with 86 passengers. Safari Quest, the smallest at 22 passengers, and the 36-passenger Safari Explorer will also sail Alaska this season. The ASC vessels are meant to be more luxurious, with larger cabins and all-inclusive pricing. \n\nItineraries: InnerSea Discoveries has added a northern Inside Passage route this season that includes several days in Glacier Bay. (The American Safari Cruises itineraries will also stop there.) Most of the cruises sail between Ketchikan and Juneau, between Seattle and Juneau, or roundtrip from Juneau. The line doesn't do many typical ""port of call"" stops, but ships may visit Wrangell, Misty Fjords and Tracy Arm. \n\nWeb Site: www.innerseadiscoveries.com \n\nThe Boat Company \n\nWho: Michael McIntosh started The Boat Company in 1979 as a nonprofit educational organization. What does that mean? A portion of the fare is tax deductible, and your trip will have a strong emphasis on conservation. This year, The Boat Company has partnered with Philippe Cousteau and EarthEcho International to create an educational program focused on the ecology of southeastern Alaska. \n\nShips: The company has two small ships, 24-passenger Mist Cove and 20-passenger Liseron. Both come with fishing equipment, so this might be your top choice if you want to spend a significant amount of time reeling them in. Past passengers have reported that the onboard chefs will cook your catch, and cleaning, packing and freezing your fish is included in the cruise price. (Orvis, the fly-fishing outfitter, occasionally sponsors trips.) An open bar is also included in the price. \n\nItineraries: The ships cruise between Sitka and Juneau, stopping for nature activities at places like Admiralty and Brothers islands, with glacier-viewing at Tracy or Endicott Arms along the way. There are no traditional port calls on these cruises, although the rates include your hotel for the first Saturday night you arrive. Your time is almost entirely spent on the water, with stops for hiking, wildlife-viewing and from-land fishing. \n\nWeb Site: www.theboatcompany.org\n\nFantasy Cruises \n\nWho: Based in Seattle, Fantasy Cruises is owned and operated by Jeff Behrens, who also acts as the cruise line's captain. (His wife, Catherine, is onboard as cruise director.) The ship has a naturalist in residence, and a hummingbird feeder onboard is a good place to practice your nature photography skills. Besides its summer Alaska trips, the line runs cruises through Puget Sound's San Juan Islands in the fall. \n\nShips: Island Spirit carries up to 32 passengers. It has a panoramic top deck observation lounge, and each stateroom has a window that opens for fresh air. Wine is included with your meals, as well as daily cocktails. The ship is the only U.S. Coast Guard-licensed small ship allowed to use battery power to charge its public areas at night. That means Island Spirit can turn off its engine at night to preserve quiet. (Using battery power also reduces the ship's carbon footprint.) \n\nItineraries: Itineraries include cruises between Sitka and Petersburg, as well as Juneau roundtrips and repositioning cruises heading up from Seattle. Stops include Dawes Glacier, Tenakee Springs and Baranoff Warm Springs on Baranoff Island. \n\nWeb Site: www.smallalaskaship.com\n\nLindblad Expeditions \n\nWho: Lindblad, the company that has run all of National Geographic's cruises since 2004, pioneered the expedition-style cruise several decades ago, and it remains a leader in the field of naturalist-led travel. You'll find not just one or two naturalists onboard these cruises, but four or five. Plus, the line's new Undersea Alaska Program adds a marine specialist onboard, who will dive up to 80 feet down to collect footage that will be shared with passengers in the evenings. You'll definitely feel like you're on a learning vacation. \n\nShips: The Lindblad Alaska fleet includes Sea Bird and Sea Lion, both of which fit 62 passengers. These ships are known for being family-friendly, with more children onboard than similar small ships. (Although this type of vacation isn't a good choice for kids who need their electronics; you're out of cell range the majority of the time.) A National Geographic certified photographer is also onboard to help with those nature shots. \n\nItineraries: Most weeklong voyages embark in Juneau and end in Sitka, and vice versa. Stops include Petersburg, Glacier Bay and Tracy Arm. Denali National Park trip extensions are also available. \n\nWeb Site: www.expeditions.com\n\nhttp://www.cruisecritic.com/articles.cfm?ID=1449"

"Travel"," Independence Square, the Petronas Twin Towers and the King’s Palace (Istana Negara). the National Museu","After morning pickup from your hotel, you’ll travel by air-conditioned minicoach through Kuala Lumpur, stopping for photos at Independence Square, the Petronas Twin Towers and the King’s Palace (Istana Negara). Your journey continues to the National Museum where you’ll peruse their collection of Malaysian artifacts dating from prehistoric times to the present. Afterward, you’ll drive past the Lake Gardens, a green oasis in the middle of the city.\n\nNext, you’ll see the National Monument, a sculpture that commemorates the Malaysians who died while fighting the Japanese occupation in World War II and in the Malayan Emergency. You'll also stop by the National Mosque and note its sleek and modern architecture, then contrast it to the blend of Eastern and Western design of the Old Railway Station. Your guide will share the history of these sites as you admire them from the outside. Your next stop will be the Royal Selangor Visitor Centre, where you'll see a elegant display of Malaysian pewter arts. \n\nAfter a full morning of Kuala Lumpur sightseeing, relax and enjoy a traditional Malaysian lunch at a local restaurant. Once you're refreshed, head to the Brickfields, a colorful residential neighborhood that's known as Little India due to its many Indian residents and businesses. \n\nFinally, you’ll drive to the craggy limestone mountain which holds the Batu Caves. An impressive golden statue of the Hindu deity Lord Murugan stands 140 feet (42.7 m) tall next to the 272 steps that lead to the caves. Your guide will take you through the cavernous rooms where you’ll find a Hindu shrine lined with colorful statues.\n\nOn your way back to Kuala Lumpur, stop at a Malaysian batik center to see how this popular textile art is made. Your city tour ends with drop-off at your hotel.  "

High net worth symposium. We want to start putting together a folder of questions and topics that I want to bring to this symposium to see if can network and get answers and get potential solutions. \n\nOne such topic or question has to do with our client Terry Robert's who is a US citizen who has been working abroad for at least the last five years in Asia, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc. So how can we do business with US citizens, existing clients, US citizens abroad. Specifically I'd love to open up some alternative investments for him. This would require opening a brokerage account and then paperwork for each individual investment. Can I overnight that to him in Singapore. Can I mail it to the New Jersey address which he uses and have it forwarded. Can I load it up into his eMoney vault and have him print it down and send it back to us because they require original signatures for the alternative investments. I would like some specific guidance as to how to work with clients who are overseas. \n\nSeparate client situation would be Edmund Verstraete who is not a US citizen, but we entered into a client relationship with him when he was here in the US. We are having difficulty assisting him now that he has moved back to his home country in Europe. I think it's either maybe Denmark or Holland. We'd like to move the money from the John Hancock variable annuity to a better product such as the Prudential variable annuity for a host of different reasons, but we are limited are in the number of companies we can work with. So how do we work with international clients is my question. \n\nAction item: Keeva, please print out these notes, put them in my folder to go to the New York City high net worth symposium. Thanks.\n\nDictation made on 3/25/2015 10:28 AM EDT.\n\n\n\nWe received Ed Baker's 2014 tax returns from his CPA.  In reviewing his tax returns, he had a W-2 of 135,000.  We had capital gains of 100,000, and he had rental real estate and S corporation distributions of 139,000.  Total income 409,000.  He has $2,000 each as a health savings account deduction (not a high priority, but be interested to know where that money is being kept and if it's being expensed out or accumulated).  He also has a self-employment health insurance deduction, $10,000, which leads me to ask the question what's he doing for retirement.  So I don't see but I didn't look for a copy of his W-2.  Does he have any type of a qualified plan that he's deferring into; for example, 401(k).  Or if he's got self-employment income, could we set up either a solo 401(k) or a profit-sharing or a SEP-IRA or a defined benefit plan and further reduce his taxable income.  So this is a potential planning strategy that I could potentially discuss with Ed and/or his tax advisor, Linda Chelf, at some point in the future.  In further reviewing the tax return, he is subject to AMT, alternative minimum tax, $8,700.  He had income tax withheld from his W-2 and made $43,000 in estimated payments and still owed over $12,000 federal.  Itemized deductions, he's doing a great job with the gifts to charity, only $620 of cash and over $31,000 of other than cash, the majority of that being appreciated securities.  On his schedule C, again, there's a small schedule C $2,200 in income for Diane for her cosmetology business.  Schedule D we had $30,000 in loss carryforward, but wound up $130,000 in total gains so that he wound up with a combined net $100,000 in capital gains for the year, so there is no longer any carryforward.\n\nHis tax return is a complex tax return because of various entities, including Baker Farms, which I believe is an S corporation.  He's got non-passive K-1 income, $139,000.  There's also special aspects having to do with schedule J, income averaging for farmers and fishermen, not something that I'm very familiar with.  So this would be a good tax return to review with his tax advisor and/or at the LPL high net worth symposium in New York as it's a complex tax return.\n\nDictation made on 3/25/2015 6:38 PM EDT."

Recommended to go at night\n\n\nDotonbori\nBest seen at night, Dotonbori never truly closes with some restaurants open 24 hours.\n\nOne of Osaka's most popular tourist destinations, this street runs parallel to the Dotonbori canal. It is a popular shopping and entertainment district and is also known as a food destination. At night it is lit by hundreds of neon lights and mechanized signs, including the famous Glico Running Man sign and Kani Doraku crab sign.\n\nDen Den Town\nHours vary by store; typically from around 10:00-11:00 to around 19:00-20:00.\nLocated in the Nipponbashi area, Den Den Town is an electronics district comparable to Tokyo's Akihabara, and you may be able to bargain to a better deal. Den Den Town is becoming known as an otaku paradise with numerous manga and anime retailers as well as maid and cosplay cafes located there.\n\n\n\n"

"Travel","Saint Petersburg 1.05.15","План поездки следующий: 1 мая, около двух часов дня, мы заселяемся в гостиницу. Тратить время в гостинице, я думаю, не имеет смысла, хотя поласкать мою крошку однозначно стоит. А вот имеет смысл с этого же момента начать наше маленькое путешествие, поэтому мне кажется, что лучшим решением будет посетить в этот пятничный день Петергоф, единственное на что стоит молиться, это на погоду - главное чтобы она была теплой и не сильно ветряной. Лучшим транспортом до Петербурга до Петергофа будет метеор - это своего рода катер, ниже ссылка на сайт с информацией о том, как добраться до императорской резиденции\nhttp://ultrakassir.ru/meteory/meteor-v-petergof\n\nА вечером, после посещения обители императоров, мы насладимся вечерним городом Петра, посмотрим на  город со крыши Исаакиевского собора. И мне хочется кинуть взор на легендарный развод питерских мостов. http://www.ptmap.ru/bridges/razvod - время развода мостов можно посмотреть на этом сайте.\nПоездка обещает быть интересной.\n\nhttp://www.the-village.ru/village/city/city/127809-smotrovye - смотровые площадки СПб\nhttp://piter.jagannath.ru/contacts/"

I thought of the obituaries that I enjoyed reading, the people that I admired… the people [who] really knew how to live. The second version was the obituary that I was heading for — a conventional, ordinary, pleasant life. The difference between the two was startling. Clearly something was going to have to change… I felt I was getting a few things figured out. But I was like a carpenter with a brand new set of tools and no wood to work on. I needed a project. And so I decided to row the Atlantic.\n\n "

This is a milestone year for global health and development.  To help us achieve our shared goals for 2015 and beyond, some of our most important research and development, delivery, and advocacy partners will gather to exchange perspectives on the greatest challenges we face - and how we can collaborate for global health impact.\n The Global Partners Forum will combine major annual meetings that in the past have been hosted separately by our Global Divisions: Global Health's Product Development Forum and Global Policy and Advocacy's Anchor Partner Summit, and a new event, Global Development's Delivery Forum. The combined forum will represent all major areas of our global health work from discovery to development, delivery, and policy and advocacy.\nObjectives of the forum include:\n* Celebrate and reflect on the accomplishments and impact of global health partners over the last 15 years\n* Consider new ways of working together across research and development, delivery, and advocacy to accelerate global health impact over the next 15 years\n* Identify innovations needed to achieve near- and long-term global health goals\n* Create opportunities to share information, learn from each other, foster greater transparency, and get business done amongst partners\nPlenaries and breakouts will focus on topics such as the sustainable development goals, women and girls, emerging infectious diseases including Ebola, and eradication. Invited participants will include select product development partners, industry leaders, regulators, non-governmental organizations, developing country governments, funders, multilaterals, technical agencies, academia, and major policy and advocacy partners. Bill and Melinda Gates, Sue Desmond-Hellmann, and other foundation representatives will present along with other global health leaders. Formal and informal networking opportunities will occur throughout the week.\nRegistration is required for this event.

"Travel","Am thuc","1. Pad Thái (Phở xào hay Bún xào kiểu Thái) \n\nMột trong những món ăn nổi tiếng và phổ biến nhất của xứ sở chùa Vàng là pad Thái, hay còn có thể hiểu là bún xào. Nguyên liệu của món ăn này gồm có mì xào trộn trứng, đậu phộng, tôm khô, đậu phụ, sốt me, đậu, đôi khi có kèm với tôm hoặc mực.\n\n\nMón ăn Thái Lan\n\nKhi được Pad Thái phát minh ra?\n\nTrong khoảng thời gian ngài P.Pibulsongkram là thủ tướng của Thái Lan (giai đoạn trong Thế chiến II), ông đã vận động người dân Thái Lan ăn các món ăn Thái Lan, sử dụng thực phẩm của Thái Lan. Và Pad Thái được phát minh, sử dụng các nguyên liệu thực phẩm ở địa phương. Sau này nó đã trở thành một món ăn quốc gia.\n\nĂn Pad Thai ở đâu?\n\nBạn có thể thưởng thức Pad Thai tại Thip Samai Pad Thai. Đây là nhà hàng lâu đời, bắt đầu xuất hiện vào năm 1966 như là một cửa hàng nhỏ bán Pad Thái Lan tại vỉa hè của Maha Chai Road, gần Samranraj, Bangkok. Do cuộc khủng hoảng chiến tranh, các gian hàng nhỏ đã ngay lập tức trở nên nổi tiếng vì chất lượng và hương vị của nó. Các thực khách thường xuyên gọi nó là “Pad Thai Pratu Phi” do vị trí của nó gần giao lộ Pratu-Phi.\n\nTheo những người hướng dẫn viên địa phương thì đây là một trong những nơi thưởng thức Pad Thai tốt nhất tại Bangkok. Một đĩa Pad Thai tuyệt vời chỉ khoảng 70 baht, bao gồm bún (theo phong cách Thái) gói với trứng chiên và tôm. Bạn có thể ăn Pad Thái với các loại đồ uống như Nước Dừa (20 baht) theo công thức của mẹ vua Rama 9. Nước dừa rất ngọt và có cùi dừa trong mỗi uống. Thứ đồ uống khác bạn có thể thưởng thức đi kèm là nước cam. Giá của nước cam thay đổi 2-3 lần một ngày tùy thuộc vào cam họ sử dụng. Giá có thể khoảng 150 baht.\n\nNhà hàng Thip Samai\nĐịa chỉ: Samran Rat, Phra Nakhon Bangkok 10200, Thailand (Nếu bạn đi taxi, hãy nói với lái xe về địa chỉ “Pad Thai Pratu Phi”)\nTel: 02-2216280Theo lời giới thiệu của những người sành ăn, bạn nên ăn tối tại Somtam Nua tại Siam Square Soi 5. Bạn cũng có thể kết hợp đi Massage tại Lek (Quảng trường Siam Soi 6). Somtam phục vụ các món ăn Isaan khá ngon (Ẩm thực khu vực Đông Bắc Thái Lan). Ẩm thực Isaan vay mượn rất nhiều từ các món ăn Lào và có sự khác biệt với ẩm thực miền trung Thái Lan.\n\nĐược biết đến nhiều nhất trong ẩm thực Isaan là Som tam (59 baht), salad cay chế biến từ đu đủ xanh. Món ăn khác bạn có thể thưởng thức là Gà chiên (98 baht), ăn ngon nhưng đừng ăn quá nhiều. Món được chế biến với tỏi chiên, thịt gà khá thơm và ngọt. Da cũng rất giòn và không quá nhiều mỡ.\n\nThực phẩm Isaan được biết đến ở Thái vì vị cay. Các món ăn cay khá phổ biển ở Đông Bắc Thái, bạn có thể thưởng thức món Súp cay với thịt lợn xương (97 baht), trà đá (40 baht).\n\nMột món ăn cũng nên ăn là Cá chiên giòn cay (95 baht), cá rô phi được chiên cùng với ớt tỏi ngâm.\n\nNhà hàng Somtam Nưa\n\nĐịa chỉ: 392/14 Soi Siam Square 5, Rama 1 Road, Bangkok\n\nĐịa chỉ: +66 (0) 22 51 48804. Chè Xôi Xoài\n\nXôi Xoài (Chè xôi xoài). Sau khi ăn Mì dạo ở Sukhumvit bạn có thể sang ngay quán Chè Xoài đối diện, cửa hàng Chè Xoài thuộc sở hữu của hai chị em.\n\nGạo nếp và xoài của họ là siêu ngon, nhiều người nhận xét rằng đây là một trong những quán xoài gạo nếp ngon nhất ở Bangkok. Thật vậy, xoài thực sự là rất ngon! Ngoài Xoài thì Sầu Riêng ở đây cũng rất ngon.\n\nXoài gạo nếp\n\nĐịa chỉ: Sukhumvit Soi 38 (xuống xe tại Thong Lo BTS, băng qua đường và bạn sẽ thấy nó)\n\nGiờ mở cửa: 8:00-02:00"

Read our tips in our Naples City Guide \nWere located right in the city centre.  Take a look at our directions and our directions video below and you wont get lost finding us!\n\nDirections\n\nHostel of the Sun is an ideal place to stay while visiting beautiful Napoli.  We are walking distance from the Historical Center, Castel Nuovo, Palazzo Reale, Palazzo Plebiscito, and the fabulous shopping on Via Toledo- to name a few.  Two of Naples most historic and loved Pizzerias, (Gino Sorbillo and Di Matteo), are a ten minute walk from our doorstep.\n\nHostel of the Sun:\n\nVia G. Melisurgo, 15\n80133, Napoli – Italy\n\nPhone: 081 4206393.  Outside Italy 0039 081 4206393\nemail: info@hostelnapoli.com Skype: hostelofthesun\n\nFrom the Train Station By Metro:\n\nWalk outside the station and take the M1 (metro line 1, be careful not to get onto the line 2) direction PISCINOLA. Tickets cost 1,30 euro and can be bought inside the station. \nGet off at UNIVERSITA.\n\nExit the station and you will see a statue of a horse right outside, in the middle of the Piazza Bovio. Look in the opposite direction the horse is looking and you will see that the street splits in two. Take the left street, Via Depretis (not the uphill road).\nYoull see a huge castle at the end of the street. Walk towards it on the left sidewalk. Before arriving at the castle, you will see a newspaper kiosk and a small street on the left, this is Via Melisurgo, our street. We are number 15, the last building on the left hand side, right after a bar with a green sign called ""Bar Seccia"" \n\n\nTo get into our building, please press 51 (buzzer) to ring reception, walk inside, make a left and take the elevator to the reception.

We will be having the first ever Fastly Engineering Summit which will take place Monday, February 23rd through Wednesday, February 25th in San Francisco. \n\nWhat is this Summit I speak of? Well, it's a time for everyone in Engineering and CS Eng, local and remote, to be in the same place at the same time to learn, hack, and have fun. While attendance is not mandatory, it would be over the top rainbows hugging platinum mane unicorns who poop diamonds amazing if everyone could make it. \n \nFor remote folks, here's some information to help you book your travel:\n\n- You'll want to arrive in San Francisco no later than Sunday, February 22nd and depart no earlier than Thursday, February 26th. If you rarely come out to San Francisco and want to make it a longer trip, please let me know so that I can help make special arrangements. If you can't get away for more than a few days, that's ok too. \n- I will be taking care of your housing arrangements. Once you have booked your airfare through Concur, please add your travel information to this google doc (https://docs.google.com/a/fastly.com/spreadsheets/d/1EGjVuNoeHcPQ1DHEOe50vogoXXhNaKKDiP2iERftYeM/edit#gid=0).\n- Please book your airfare ASAP. Deadline to book travel is Monday, January 19th.\n\nI also need everyone to add their dietary restrictions, if any, to this google doc. \n\nI will be sending out the calendar invite immediately after this email. In order to plan accordingly, I need everyone to ACCEPT or DENY the invite so I can get an approximate headcount. Some of the things we will be doing will require tickets to be purchased, so no accept the invite, no ticket for you! \n\nIf you have any questions about any of this, please shout at me! Can't wait to see you all next month! "

Five sections of the Berlin Wall, in total measuring 12 feet high and 20 feet long, have been on display here since 1990. Dazzling work by German artists Thierry Noir and Kiddy Citny cover the wall's western-facing side. The eastern side, meanwhile, remains a blank slab of concrete—a reminder of the oppressive political regime in the former East Germany. At first glance, this artifact appears to be just another public mural; it goes largely unnoticed by the office workers who sit in the park on their lunch break. [Editor's note: In September 2014, the remnants were removed for restoration work.] —AB"

"Travel","cancun","没去过cancun，但是感觉波多黎各的活动没有适合老的小的，都是些划艇、潜水，即使去热带雨林也要hiking很久的，路又滑\n\n波多黎各挺适合父母亚, 逛逛城堡\老城\去沙滩游泳\去雨林hiking\再看看荧光海, 一周很妥当,而且每项活动都不是很累, 又有variety\n\n新年我自己带我妈和俩小娃去的cancun，住的all inclusive，太方便了，机场直接接到resort，每天睁眼就想想去哪个餐厅吃饭，吃完挖沙子或者泡pool，然后再想下顿去哪个餐厅。一个星期没出resort也玩的很好。lz你看看cancun 的moon palace，通过ebay上的agent订一个星期的package，除了all inclusive外每个房间还送两个trip，两次message，1500的酒店credits可以用来选和海豚游泳或者spa或者其他one day trip，既适合扶老携幼的休闲度假，也可以出去看看附近的古迹\n\n问all inclusive的统一回复在这里，我也是先在travel版上做了做功课，最后订的moon palace，算是cancun最大的all inclusive resort，确实很大，需要坐shuttle在里面转来转去。而且太适合扶老携幼了，在那里我发现老美都是一大家子老少三代的一起去，可见是family friendly的地方。\n我先ebay上搜cancun moon palace就出来很多个agent，多问几个比较一下价钱，其实都差不多。发信告诉agent时间人数，几个大人几个孩子（4岁以上要每天多50块钱，4岁以下free），他会报价钱。如果合适就让他给你订，但是钱不通过这个agent，moon palace的客服会直接给你打电话问你的卡号信息，然后是agent给你发确认信，包括时间，包含的服务，送的1500 credits怎么花什么的。不同时段价钱不同，我订的是1/2-1/9号，$1720，八天七夜，两大两小，供参考\n\n我们去的是cancun riu palace peninsula，酒店好几个pool, 餐馆选择很多，而且有这家的wrist band可以去所有Riu Palace和Riu的酒店，推荐！\n\n不喜欢 all inclusive 也可以去 cancun 啊，比如 fiesta americana at coral beach 就不是 all inclusive 的，5 star hotel, 也很 family friendly.哪天想在 hotel 里面吃喝也可以，价格也比较合适。要是哪天全天抱团出去玩，就不用浪费那个钱了，非常 flexible."

While there also try their famous Rum Swizzle. The Swizzle Inn has two locations:\nThe Swizzle Inn, located in Bailey's Bay (20 miles east of King's Warf see map and 7 miles east of Hamilton see map.)\nThe Swizzle is located on the South Shore near Elbow Beach.\n\nWhich are the best souvenirs to buy in Bermuda? Where can I get them?\nThere are plenty of excellent souvenirs and gifts to be had on Bermuda. There is no sales tax and duties are free or atleast reduced. There is also no shortage of good places to shop. For those that like to search for deals, you will find them here.\nUnder $25:\nA bottle of Gosling’s Black Rum – can be picked up at any liquor store on the island.\n\nBeaches\nSome would say, that best advice when looking for a beach on an island is to ask the taxi driver: ""Where do all the cruise ship passengers generally go?"" then choose a beach in the opposite direction. Below are a couple of beaches we like:\nElbow Beach, located 13.4 miles southeast of King's Warf (see map) and 2.5 miles south of Hamilton, is protected by coral reefs which surround it and make it one of the safest beaches on the island to swim. The beach is divided into two sections: private on the east, which is reserved for hotel guests and public on the west side of the beach.\nHorseshoe Bay, located on the south coast about 10 miles south of King's Warf (see map) and 5.6 miles southwest of Hamilton, is perhaps the best known and most popular public beach on the island. Not all beaches on Bermuda are public, so take care not to lay out your towel on a private beach. There are changing facilities and a snack concession on this beach.\nWarwick Long Bay, located on the south coast of the island is about 7 miles southwest of the port (see map) and under 5 miles southwest of Hamilton, is the longest beach on the island and not as well known as others that cater to cruise ship passengers. Although on the south side of the island, the beach on Warwick Long Bay is protected by the reef and does not experience turbulent surf.\n\nWhat are the best eats in Bermuda?\nBermuda lobster (also known as guinea chicks) is very popular as is mussel pie, a pie made with mussels, potatoes, bacon, onion & papaya seasoned with curry powder & thyme.\nWhere are the best places to try them?\nThe Lobster Pot Restaurant in Hamilton serves fresh rockfish sandwiches, platters of tuna and wahoo, and fish chowder with a shot of rum (if requested) along with fresh lobster dishes. (Click here for Menu)\nThe Somerset Country Squire Pub & Restaurant, located on Mangrove Bay offers traditional English pub food, including mussel pie, best washed down with a pint of Guinness. (Click here for Hours and Menu)\nNote: The dress code on Bermuda, especially in most of the finer restaurants, is a bit more conservative than on other Caribbean islands. While a suit jacket (or tie) is no longer required for men, you must wear a collared shirt and long pants (some restaurants also allow Bermuda shorts)."
