"Idols","Jeremy Howard","AMA\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2p6k20/im_jeremy_howard_enlitic_ceo_kaggle_past/\n\nSince I know that I have no idea what I'm doing, I speak to a lot of people, ask a lot of questions, read a lot of books, and watch a lot of online courses. And then I practice — a lot! I try to spend at least half of every day learning or practising something new, and this is something that I have done for the last 20+ years…\n\nI think that the best way to learn machine learning is through applying it. I do think that entering Kaggle competitions is a fantastic way to develop your skills. Personally, I don't have any technical training, but I have read hundreds of books and completed many online courses. I found that Kaggle competitions let me develop my skills further and faster than any other approach.\n\nSpecifically, the courses that I would recommend our the machine learning course on Coursera, the introduction to data science course on Coursera, and the neural networks for machine learning course — surprise surprise, also on Coursera! Also, all of the introductory books here are a good choice.\n\nThe most important thing, of course, is to practice stop download some open datasets from the web, and try to build models and develop insights, and post them on your blog. And be sure to compete in machine learning competitions — that's really the only way to know whether your approaches are working or not.\n\nTherefore, I do not use the term ""AI"" in my writing or speeches. I do not think we should be trying to ""build a brain"", but instead should be trying to end scarcity. \n\nBecause imaging is such a critical type of data or medicine, my belief is that recent advances in computer vision will be more impactful in medicine than any other area (other than, perhaps, robotics). So I wouldn't describe the medicine as an ""other area"".\n\nThe problem is that many, if not most, machine learning researchers are not working on the areas that are most impactful. In particular, in computer vision there is an unfortunate tendency for people now to focus on winning the Imagenet competition, which has very little relevance to the most important problems in industry and science today.\n\nIt seems to me that humans can provide three basic inputs into processes: energy, perception, and judgement. The Industrial Revolution removed the need for humans to provide energy inputs into processes, and therefore in the developed world today nearly all jobs are in the service sector. Computers are now approaching or passing human capability in perception, and in the areas where the bulk of the employment exists also surpass human capabilities in judgement (because computers can processed more data in a less biased way). So if economists are going to claim that there will be new industries which require human input, I think they need to explain exactly what the human will be doing, and why the computer would not be able to do it at least as well. -> Human emotion / human bias or creativity like a great movie / art\n\nIt seems to be making an impact on unemployment already. For instance, see the analysis in The Second Machine Age. Since this impact is accelerating, more and more people will be experiencing it directly in the next 3 to 5 years.\n\nYou would need to be an excellent coder, a competent machine learning practitioner, and have a good understanding of the issues in medicine today. Success in machine learning competitions is the best way to show your coding and machine learning capabilities. Or build a great biomedical engineering tool, and make it available as open source. Or put together a medical dataset, and analyse it to generate some interesting insights, making them available through your blog, or even an academic publication.\n\nI think that more scientific progress can be made by creating huge randomised experiments, and analysing them with machine learning, rather than standard hypothesis testing. I think that the traditional human approach of creating small experiments which only test one thing at a time are no longer the best way to create new scientific insights, in most situations.\n\n"

Transfer to a bowl, and allow to cool.\n    Preheat oven to 350. Season the chicken thighs with the salt, pepper and 2 tablespoons of the spice mix, along with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.\n    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat, and set a large bowl of ice water to the side. Core the tomatoes, and score an X on their bottoms. Boil the cauliflower florets in the water for 3 minutes, then submerge them in the ice water. Boil the tomatoes for 20 seconds, and chill them in the ice water as well. Remove the cauliflower when it is cold, and pat the florets dry. Peel the skin off the tomatoes, then cut them into quarters lengthwise. Trim away the seeds to make petals.\n    Heat the remaining olive oil in a large sauté pan set over medium heat, and sear the chicken in batches, starting skin-side down, until the thighs are browned. Remove the chicken to a large Dutch oven or tagine pot. Remove all but two tablespoons of the fat in pan, then return it to the heat, and brown the cauliflower and add to the chicken.\n    Reduce heat below the pan, and add the onion, garlic, ginger and saffron. Cook, stirring, until the onions are translucent, approximately 5 minutes. Add tomato paste and chicken stock, and simmer until reduced by 1/3.\n    Pour sauce over the chicken and cauliflower, cover the pot and transfer to oven for 20 minutes. Remove, stir in the tomatoes, preserved lemon and olives, then cover the pot again and cook for an additional 20 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Serve the chicken in the pot, garnished with the cilantro leaves, with couscous. Reserve remaining spice mix for the next batch or another use. It keeps well in a sealed container."

"Personalities","Rabindranath Tagore","""Tagore"" redirects here. For other uses, see Tagore (disambiguation).\n\nRabindranath Tagore[a] (i/rəˈbindrəˈnɑːt ˈtɑːɡɔr/; Bengali pronunciation: [robind̪ro nat̪ʰ ʈʰakur]), also written Rabīndranātha Thākura (7 May 1861 – 7 August 1941),[b] sobriquet Gurudev,[c] was a Bengali polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of Gitanjali and its ""profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse"", he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. In translation his poetry was viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his ""elegant prose and magical poetry"" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. Tagore introduced new prose and verse forms and the use of colloquial language into Bengali literature, thereby freeing it from traditional models based on classical Sanskrit. He was highly influential in introducing the best of Indian culture to the West and vice versa,... \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore"

Heat coconut oil in a large soup pot on medium heat, 2 minutes. Add onions, then smash garlic cloves with the flat side of a knife or the bottom of a glass and add to pan. Stir often and cook until the onions and garlic are soft and golden, but not browned, about 7 minutes. Add salt, ginger, and black pepper; stir to combine.\n\n2. Toss the zucchini into the pot. Stir to coat the zucchini with fat, then cook ’til beginning to soften, about 5 minutes.\n\n3. Add the broth, bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to simmer. Let the zucchini cook 45 to 60 minutes until it’s very soft.\n\n4. VERY carefully, purée the zucchini and broth in a blender or food processor, or with an immersion blender. If you’re using a blender, work in batches, filling the canister only halfway and holding a towel over the lid while you purée. Eat immediately, or store in a covered container in the fridge.\n\nTasty garnishes: My favorite right now is dried or fresh chopped chives. The green tops of scallions are also yummy. You would not be remiss if you drizzled a little sesame oil across the top (but only if you’re not on the AIP).\n\nLesson Learned #1\n\nIt doesn’t matter how you cut the zucchini since you’re cooking it until it’s very soft and then puréeing the bejeezus out of it.  However, zucchini is round, which means it rolls, and generally speaking:\nrolly things + sharp things ≠ good things\n\nHere’s what to do: Make sure your knife is sharp. Carefully (1) cut the zuke in half crosswise, then (2) cut those halves in half lengthwise to make half-moon-shaped logs, then place the logs flat side down, and (3) cut into 1/2-inch thick half-moons."

"Groceries","Хрян","Хрянът (Armoracia rusticana) е род многогодишно растение от семейство Кръстоцветни (Brassicaceae), в което са и синапът и различните видове зеле. Растението вероятно произлиза от югоизточна Европа и западна Азия, но в наши дни се отглежда по целия свят. Достига 1,5 m на височина и се отглежда главно заради големия си бял заострен корен, въпреки че и листата могат да се ядат.\n\nКоренът му се използва като зеленчук или смлян като подправка и е бил използван за горчива подправка в ястието за Пасха в някои еврейски общности. Хрянът, понякога смесен със сметана се сервира често с печено или варено говеждо месо или кренвирши, както и с пушена риба. Използва се и в някои видове горчица. В България се сервира настърган в оцет към свинска пача. Също така, много от това, което минава за уасаби е всъщност обикновен хрян, оцветен в зелено.\n\nСамият корен на хряна почти няма аромат. Когато се нареже или настърже обаче, ензими от разрушените клетки на растението разлагат синигрина (вид глюкозинолат) на алилизотиоцианат (горчично масло), който дразни синусите и очите. След като се настърже, ако не се използва веднага или смеси с оцет, коренът потъмнява и губи острите си миризма и вкус и става неприятно горчив, ако се изложи на въздух и топлина.\n\nКазват, че повече от една трета от производството на хрян в САЩ се отглежда в един малък район около Колинсвил, Илинойс, самонарекъл се „Хрянова столица на Света“, поради което дори се изнася в чужбина като луксозна версия на продукта в места, известни повече с яденето на корена. Най-голямото производство за вътрешни нужди в САЩ идва от О Клер, Уисконсин.\n\nДействие и приложениеРедактиране\nАпетитовъзбуждащо, жлъчегонно, подобряващо храносмилането, антиревматично, противомикробно, диуретично. Местното дразнещо действие на хряна се свързва с гликозида синигрин, който освобождава при хидролиза алилсинапено етерично масло. Това дразнещо рецепторите действие обуславя стимулирането на храносмилането, както и антиревматичния и антидиуретичния ефект. Експериментално е доказано, че свежите корени на хряна понижават нивото на глюкозата в кръвта и подобряват протичането на експериментален диабет. Наличието на антибиотика арморацин придава противомикробно действие на корените."

Dust with the 30g of castor sugar, tapping out any excess.\n\nPut the raspberries in a small pot over a medium heat and cook for 5 minutes if fresh and 7 minutes if frozen and then blend the berries until smooth using a stick blender.\n\nStrain the raspberries through a fine sieve, working the pulp through and leaving the seeds behind. Put the puree berries back into the pot and return it to the heat. Add the 55g castor sugar and the lemon juice and bring this to the boil.\n\nWhisk the cornflour and the water together until its smooth and whisk this into the hot puree. continue to whisk for a minute and then remove from the heat. * I found a few lumps developed so I used my stick blender again to smooth these out.\n\nAllow the puree to cool in the fridge.\n\nBeat the egg whites until soft peaks. Add the remaining castor sugar slowly while the mixer is running and continue to whisk until the meringue is smooth and glossy.\n\nFold the cooled raspberry through the meringue and fill the ramekins to the top. Smooth out the surface or leave a few peaks which can be very pretty. Bake for 10 – 13 minutes and serve immediately.\n\n* I managed to make 3 small and 4 larger souffles with this recipe."

Sesame-Honey Tempeh & Quinoa Bowl","INGREDIENTS \nQUINOA & CARROT SLAW \n1 1/2 cups water \n3/4 cup quinoa, rinsed \n2 cups grated carrots (about 3 large) \n2 tablespoons rice vinegar \n2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted (see Tip) \n1 tablespoon sesame oil \n1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce \nSESAME-HONEY TEMPEH \n2 tablespoons sesame oil \n2 8-ounce packages tempeh (see Note), crumbled into bite-size pieces \n3 tablespoons honey \n3 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce \n2 tablespoons water \n1 teaspoon cornstarch \n2 scallions, sliced \n \nPREPARATION \nTo prepare quinoa: Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add quinoa and return to a boil. Reduce to a low simmer, cover and cook until the water is absorbed, 10 to 14 minutes. Uncover and let stand. \nTo prepare carrot slaw: Meanwhile, combine carrots, rice vinegar, sesame seeds, 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon soy sauce in a medium bowl. Set aside. \nTo prepare tempeh: Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add tempeh and cook, stirring frequently, until beginning to brown, 7 to 9 minutes. \nCombine honey, 3 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons water and cornstarch in a small bowl. Add to the pan and cook, stirring, until the sauce has thickened and coats the tempeh, about 1 minute. \nDivide the quinoa among 4 bowls and top each with 1/2 cup carrot slaw and 3/4 cup tempeh mixture. Sprinkle with scallions. \n \nTIPS & NOTES \nTip: To toast sesame seeds, place in a small dry skillet and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant and lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes. \nIngredient Note: Look for tempeh near refrigerated tofu in natural-foods stores and many large supermarkets."

"Groceries","Shakshuka","1. Heat a deep, large skillet or sauté pan on medium. Slowly warm olive oil in the pan. Add chopped onion, sauté for a few minutes until the onion begins to soften. Add garlic and continue to sauté till mixture is fragrant.\n\n2. Add the bell pepper, sauté for 5-7 minutes over medium until softened.\n\n3. Add tomatoes and tomato paste to pan, stir till blended. Add spices and sugar, stir well, and allow mixture to simmer over medium heat for 5-7 minutes till it starts to reduce. At this point, you can taste the mixture and spice it according to your preferences. Add salt and pepper to taste, more sugar for a sweeter sauce, or more cayenne pepper for a spicier shakshuka (be careful with the cayenne… it is extremely spicy!).\n\n4. Crack the eggs, one at a time, directly over the tomato mixture, making sure to space them evenly over the sauce. I usually place 4-5 eggs around the outer edge and 1 in the center. The eggs will cook ""over easy"" style on top of the tomato sauce.\n\n5. Cover the pan. Allow mixture to simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked and the sauce has slightly reduced. Keep an eye on the skillet to make sure that the sauce doesn't reduce too much, which can lead to burning.\n\n6. Garnish with the chopped parsley, if desired. Shakshuka can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. For breakfast, serve with warm crusty bread or pita that can be dipped into the sauce (if you’re gluten-intolerant or celebrating Passover, skip the bread). For dinner, serve with a green side salad for a light, easy meal."

Add the pasta and cook until tender (7-10) minutes. Drain the pasta in a colander.\nWhile waiting for the pasta to cook, dice the onion and mince the garlic. Cook both in a large skillet with the olive oil over medium-low heat until softened and transparent (about 5 minutes).\nAdd the diced tomatoes (with juices), oregano, basil, red pepper flakes, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper to the skillet with the onions and garlic. Stir to combine. Add the tomato paste and a ½ cup of water to the skillet and stir until the tomato paste is dissolved into the sauce.\nTurn the heat down to low. Cut the cream cheese into a few pieces and then add them to the skillet with the tomato sauce. Use a whisk to stir the sauce until the cream cheese has fully melted in and the sauce is creamy. Add half of the Parmesan to the skillet and whisk until it is melted in. Add the remainder of the parmesan and whisk until melted in again.\nAdd the fresh spinach and gently stir it into the sauce until it has wilted (3-5 minutes). Add the pasta and stir until it is well coated in the creamy tomato sauce. Taste and adjust the salt and pepper as needed. Serve warm."

"Groceries","Kata bijak bob sadino","Inspirasi sore setelah long weekend\n\nBob Sadino (1933-2015)\n• Membawa selusin bodyguard bukan jaminan keamanan. Tapi rendah hati, ramah, dan tidak mencari musuh, itulah kunci keamanan.\n\n• Obat dan vitamin bukan jaminan hidup sehat. Jaga ucapan, jaga hati, istirahat cukup, makan dengan gizi seimbang dan olahraga yang teratur, itulah kunci hidup sehat.\n\n• Rumah mewah bukan jaminan keluarga bahagia. Saling mengasihi, menghormati, dan memaafkan, itulah kunci keluarga bahagia.\n\n• Gaji tinggi bukan jaminan kepuasan hidup. Bersyukur, berbagi, dan saling menyayangi, itulah kunci kepuasan hidup.\n\n• Kaya raya bukan jaminan hidup terhormat. Tapi jujur, sopan, murah hati, tidak tamak dan menghargai sesama, itulah kunci hidup terhormat.\n\n• Hidup berfoya-foya bukan jaminan banyak sahabat. Tapi setia kawan, bijaksana, mau menghargai, menerima teman apa adanya dan suka menolong, itulah kunci banyak sahabat.\n\n• Satpam dan tembok rumah yang kokoh bukan jaminan hidup tenang. Hati yang damai, kasih dan tiada kebencian itulah kunci ketenangan dan rasa aman.\n\n• Hidup kita itu sebaiknya ibarat “bulan & matahari” — dilihat orang atau tidak, ia tetap bersinar. Dihargai orang atau tidak, ia tetap menerangi. Diterimakasihi atau tidak, ia tetap “berbagi”.\n\n• Jika Anda bilang Anda susah, banyak orang yang lebih susah dari Anda. Jika Anda bilang Anda kaya, banyak orang yang lebih kaya dari Anda. Di atas langit, masih ada langit. Suami, istri, anak, jabatan, harta adalah ""titipan sementara"". Itulah kehidupan.\n\n• Nikmatilah hidup selama Anda masih memilikinya dan terus belajar untuk bersyukur dengan keadaanmu! Karena Anda tidak akan tahu kapan Tuhan akan datang dan mengatakan pada Anda, “Ini saatnya pulang!” — memaksa Anda meninggalkan apa pun yang Anda cintai, dan Anda banggakan, serta sombongkan.\n\nLuar biasa!!! Semoga bisa menjadi inspirasi bagi kita semua.\n�"

"Terms","QoS policy","FIFO (first-in, first-out). FIFO entails no concept of priority or classes of traffic. With FIFO, transmission of packets out the interface occurs in the order the packets arrive. \n \n•Weighted fair queueing (WFQ). WFQ offers dynamic, fair queueing that divides bandwidth across queues of traffic based on weights. (WFQ ensures that all traffic is treated fairly, given its weight.) To understand how WFQ works, consider the queue for a series of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) packets as a queue for the collective and the queue for discrete interactive traffic packets as a queue for the individual. Given the weight of the queues, WFQ ensures that for all FTP packets sent as a collective an equal number of individual interactive traffic packets are sent.) \n \nGiven this handling, WFQ ensures satisfactory response time to critical applications, such as interactive, transaction-based applications, that are intolerant of performance degradation. For serial interfaces at E1 (2.048 Mbps) and below, flow-based WFQ is used by default. When no other queueing strategies are configured, all other interfaces use FIFO by default. \n \nThere are four types of WFQ: \n \n–Flow-based WFQ (WFQ) \n \n–Distributed WFQ (DWFQ) \n \n–Class-based WFQ (CBWFQ) \n \n–Distributed class-based WFQ (DCBWFQ) \n \n•Custom queueing (CQ). With CQ, bandwidth is allocated proportionally for each different class of traffic. CQ allows you to specify the number of bytes or packets to be drawn from the queue, which is especially useful on slow interfaces. \n \n•Priority queueing (PQ). With PQ, packets belonging to one priority class of traffic are sent before all lower priority traffic to ensure timely delivery of those packets."

I also like the block and crumble it myself).\nSalt, to taste (remember that the olives and feta are very salty)\nBlack pepper\nFor the vinaigrette\n1/3 Cup. balsamic vinegar\n2 cloves fresh garlic, crushed\n½ tsp. black pepper\n½ Cup. extra virgin olive oil\nInstructions\nCook and drain the orzo according to the package's directions (I personally like to salt the water, but it’s up to you). Make sure that the orzo is not overcooked. Immediately after draining the pasta in a colander, rinse it with cold water. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the orzo and mix well to prevent the orzo from clumping. Sprinkle some fresh ground black pepper and let it sit in the colander over a bowl until it has completely cooled.\nMeanwhile, whisk the balsamic vinegar, garlic, and black pepper together. Slowly add the olive oil until it begins to thicken and set aside.\nIn a large mixing bowl toss together the orzo, olives, onions, celery, bell peppers, scallions, sun-dried tomatoes, basil, spinach, and feta cheese. Mix until combined. Pour the balsamic vinaigrette over the salad and toss until all the ingredients are well dressed. Taste and adjust seasoning."

Otsu","1 teaspoon pine nuts \n1 teaspoon sunflower seeds \n1/2 cup / 2 oz / 60 g black sesame seeds \n1 1/2 tablespoons natural cane sugar  \n1 1/2 tablespoons shoyu, tamari, or soy sauce  \n1 1/2 teaspoons mirin \nScant 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil \n2 tablespoons brown rice vinegar \n1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper \nFine-grain sea salt \n12 ounces / 340 g soba noodles \n12 ounces / 340 g extra-firm tofu  \nExtra-virgin olive oil \n1 bunch green onions, white and light green parts, thinly sliced \n \nToast the pine nuts and sunflower seeds in a large skillet over medium heat until golden, shaking the pan regularly. Add the sesame seeds to the pan and toast for a minute or so. It's hard to tell when they are toasted; look closely and use your nose. Remove from the heat as soon as you smell a hint of toasted sesame; if you let them go much beyond that, you'll start smelling burned sesame - not good. Transfer to a mortar and pestle and crush the mixture; the texture should be like black sand. Alternatively, you can use a food processor. Stir in the sugar, shoyu, mirin, sesame oil, brown rice vinegar, and cayenne pepper. Taste and adjust if needed. \n \nBring a large pot of water to a boil. Salt generously, add the soba, and cook according to the package instructions until tender. Drain, reserving some of the noodle cooking water, and rinse under cold running water. \n \nWhile the noodles are cooking, drain the tofu, pat it dry, and cut into matchstick shapes. Season the tofu with a pinch of salt, toss with a small amount of oil, and cook in a large skillet over medium-high heat for a few minutes, tossing every couple minutes, until the pieces are browned on all sides. \n \nReserve a heaping tablespoon of the sesame paste, then thin the rest with 1/3 cup / 80 ml of the hot noodle water. In a large mixing bowl, combine the soba, half of the green onions, and the black sesame paste. Toss until well combined. Add the tofu and toss again gently. Serve topped with a tiny dollop of the reserved sesame paste and the remaining green onions."

It doesn't happen often, but is possible if many investors are short selling a particular security.\n\n"

Coat a pot large enough to accommodate all the meat and vegetables with olive oil and bring to a high heat. Add the short ribs to the pan and brown very well, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Do not overcrowd pan. Cook in batches, if necessary.\n\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F.\n\nWhile the short ribs are browning, puree all the vegetables and garlic in the food processor until it forms a coarse paste. When the short ribs are very brown on all sides, remove them from the pan. Drain the fat, coat the bottom of same pan with fresh oil and add the pureed vegetables. Season the vegetables generously with salt and brown until they are very dark and a crud has formed on the bottom of the pan, approximately 5 to 7 minutes. Scrape the crud and let it reform. Scrape the crud again and add the tomato paste. Brown the tomato paste for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the wine and scrape the bottom of the pan. Lower the heat if things start to burn. Reduce the mixture by half. \n\nReturn the short ribs to the pan and add 2 cups water or until the water has just about covered the meat. Add the thyme bundle and bay leaves. Cover the pan and place in the preheated oven for 3 hours. Check periodically during the cooking process and add more water, if needed. Turn the ribs over halfway through the cooking time. Remove the lid during the last 20 minutes of cooking to let things get nice and brown and to let the sauce reduce. When done the meat should be very tender but not falling apart. Serve with the braising liquid.\n\n"

This pork roast is delicious served with saffron rice and Brussels Sprouts. Most people will agree that this is a five star recipe and it's easy to prepare and enjoy. It's really one of the best recipes for pork roast cooked in the slow cooker that I've ever found.\n\nIngredients For Tangy Slow Cooker Pork Roast\n\n1. One Lean Two And One Half Pound Boneless Pork Roast.\n\n2. One Large Purple Or Red Sweet Onion Sliced Thin.\n\n3. One Cup Hot Water.\n\n4. One Fourth Cup Brown Sugar.\n\n5. Three Tablespoons Red Wine.\n\n6. Two Tablespoons Soy Sauce.\n\n7. Two Tablespoons Ketchup.\n\n8. One Teaspoon Ground Sea Salt.\n\n9. One Teaspoon Ground Black Pepper.\n\n10. One Teaspoon Garlic Powder.\n\nYou want to be sure to use either a large red or purple sweet onion and you will want to peel it and cut it in very thin slices. Place the sliced onion in the bottom of your slow cooker or crock pot and then place your pork roast on top of the onions.\n\nNow with a wire whisk mix all the rest of your ingredients together very well in a bowl and then pour all the ingredients in on top of the pork roast.\n\nYou'll want to turn the crock pot on high and cook for 4-6 hours or until the pork roast is cooked tender. It should not start to dry out but if it does add a half cup of water at a time if it begins to look dry.\n\nI think you'll find once you have this pork roast cooked that you'll have a delicious tangy pork roast that everyone will love. With the saffron rice and the Orange Glazed Brussels Sprouts you'll have a meal you won't soon forget. If you enjoy pork roast I think you'll find that this is one of the best recipes ever for pork roast.\n\nIt will be much easier to slice up and serve if you'll allow it to cool slightly before you try to serve it. You can also use the left over pork roast to make delicious Cuban Sandwiches. Those sweet"

You second.\n\nI do not dress for the attention of other people. I dress like I do for me. If I want to put makeup on one day to feel better about myself before going out to do the shopping, I will. If I want to wear something nice, or try a new outfit combination before leaving the house, I will.\n\nYou will accept this and you will accept that I have not and will not dress like a ""slag"" when I am out and about with or without you.

"Terms","Short Covering","Sooner or later, you must ""close"" the short by buying back the same number of shares (called covering) and returning them to your broker. If the price drops, you can buy back the stock at the lower price and make a profit on the difference. If the price of the stock rises, you have to buy it back at the higher price, and you lose money.\n\n\nShort covering refers to the purchase of the exact same security that was initially sold short, since the short-sale process involved borrowing the security and selling it in the market\n\nR"

Place two pieces of chicken at a time between two pieces of parchment paper as seen in photo below. Pound with a flat mallet, until the cutlets are about 1/4-inch thick.  Set aside and repeat until all the chicken is pounded thin. Put some flour in a shallow dish. Season each side of the chicken cutlets with salt and pepper. Dredge each cutlet lightly on each side with flour.\n\nHeat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is nice and hot, brown a few cutlets at a time for 3-5 minutes on each side until golden. Once the chicken is brown, place the pieces in a single layer on a cookie sheet with a rim, or a glass casserole dish. Continue until all the chicken is browned.\n\nLower the heat to medium and add the prosciutto to the drippings in the pan, sauté for a minute or two until browned. Add the mushrooms, season with a little salt and pepper and sauté until they are nicely browned on each side.  Turn up the heat and pour the Marsala in the pan and boil down for a minute so the alcohol cooks off. Then add the chicken stock and the butter.  Allow it to cook for a minute or two. Pour the sauce over the chicken, cover with foil and place in a 350-degree oven for about 20 minutes. Remove chicken and sprinkle with fresh parsley before serving.\n\nCook’s Notes:\nYou can sauté the chicken, place it in a baking dish or cookie sheet and cover it with foil. Then cook the sauce separately and set aside in a separate bowl. Refrigerate everything and take it out 20 minutes before company arrives. Then preheat your oven, pour sauce over chicken and cook for 20-30 minutes before serving."

Slice chicken breasts in half, as if you were butterflying them.  Place them in a gallon zip top bag and flatten them uniformly with a meat pounder (or heavy pan, or wine bottle, etc).   \n\nIn a bowl, add all of the marinade ingredients together:  oil, lime zest, cumin, soy sauce, salt, sugar, curry powder, coconut milk, lime juice, and Serrano pepper if you are using one.  This marinade may taste pretty salty to you right now, but once we put it over the chicken and bland rice, it will balance out.  Pour the marinade over the chicken in the zip top bag, squeeze the air out and allow to marinade at least 30 minutes, or preferably up to 2 hours in the fridge.  (I allowed one hour.)  \n\nAfter marinating, grill the chicken over moderately high heat in a pan with a bit of cooking spray or canola oil in it.  Get the pan really hot before you add the meat.  You want it to sear.  Allow to sit without moving it for several minutes on each side until just cooked.  The time will depend on the thickness of the meat.  While cooking the meat,  add the marinade to a small saucepan and bring to a full boil for at least 2-3 minutes.  This is sufficient to kill all of the bacteria in it.  Or you could double the marinade, divide in two, and just toss the part that you used for the chicken. \n\nServe the chicken and a drizzle of the sauce over rice with chopped cilantro and fresh lime wedges.  This is a very important part, as these flavors bring balance and brightness to the dish."

The four simple ingredients are probably in your pantry right now! Once you go bacon crack, you can't go back.\nIngredients\n1 lb. bacon\n1 pkg Pillsbury crescent rolls\n½ cup maple syrup\n¾ cup brown sugar\nInstructions\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and liberally grease the foil with cooking spray. Unroll the crescent rolls into one single plane of dough and pinch any perforations together to seal. Stretch the dough out a little with your hands so it's even. Prick the dough with a fork all over. Set aside.\nMeanwhile, cook your bacon. I like cooking mine in a skillet, but you can bake it - whichever you prefer. Cook it until it's technically safe enough to eat and just about done, but still lighter in color and not quite crispy. You don't want it fully cooked and crispy as it will continue to cook in the oven. I pulled mine out of the pan right when they were a medium-pink color. Drain the bacon on a paper towel-lined plate.\nDrizzle ¼th cup of the maple syrup over the crescent roll dough. Sprinkle with about ¼th cup of the brown sugar. Top with torn pieces of the cooked bacon. Drizzle the remaining maple syrup on top of the bacon pieces, and top with the remaining brown sugar.\nBake for approx. 25 minutes or until bubbling and caramelized. Remove from the oven and allow the pan to come to room temperature or warm to the touch before cutting or breaking into pieces. You can serve this at room temperature or slightly warmed. It tastes best the day of, but can be eaten the next day if stored airtight."

Pat the pork roast dry with paper towels. Use a small sharp knife to make slits all over the pork, then insert the garlic slivers into the slits.\n\n2. In a small bowl, mix the salt and dried herbs, using your fingers to crush the leaves and mix them with the salt. Rub the mixture all over the pork roast, working into the nooks and crannies.\n\n3. Place the pork roast in the slow cooker and cook on low for 14 to 16 hours. As the pork roasts, the pan of the slow cooker will fill with liquid. You have two choices: (1) let it go and pour off the liquid when the meat is finished cooking; or (2) halfway through cooking, remove the lid and carefully pour off the liquid. Put the lid back on the pork and let it continue roasting; refrigerate the liquid in a glass bowl/jar or BPA-free container so the grease can separate from the luscious juice. I like to pour off the liquid so the outside of the roast gets crispier.\n\n4. When the meat is finished roasting, it’s fall-apart tender. You can either shred it with forks, mixing the crusty bits with the interior, tender bits — or break it into serving-size hunks. It’s crazy-good either way. Remember the juice you put in the fridge? Now you can easily skim off the excess fat, re-heat the juice in a pan on the stove, and use it as a sauce for the cooked meat."

Fill a medium bowl with ice water and season with salt, as well. Boil the spinach, uncovered, until tender, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, (do not drain), and immediately plunge the spinach into the ice water. Drain and squeeze the excess water from the spinach, and finely chop. Alternatively, if using thawed spinach, simply squeeze, and finely chop.\n\nIn the same large pot of boiling water, cook the pasta shells until al dente, tender but still slightly firm. Drain and pat dry.\n\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\n\nCover the bottom of a 9- x 13-inch ovenproof baking dish with 1 cup of the marinara sauce. In a medium mixing bowl, evenly combine the ricotta, mozzarella, and 1/3 cup of the Parmesan, the eggs, and the spinach. Season with the 1/2 teaspoon salt, nutmeg, and pepper to taste. Spoon the cheese mixture into the manicotti shell and line them up in the baking dish. Cover with the remaining sauce. Scatter the remaining cheese on top and dot with the butter. Bake for 30 minutes. Serve immediately.\n\nMARINARA SAUCE\nHeat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute the onion and garlic, stirring, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and the herb sprigs and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes.\n\nRemove and discard the herb sprigs. Stir in the salt and season with pepper to taste. Use now, or store covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 2 months.\n\nYield: 3 1/2 cups"
