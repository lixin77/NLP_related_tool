"Places to Go","SF Tourist Info","For families with kids 6-12:\nI don't have hotel recommendations other than to try getting one near the wharf area. Then you can walk easily most everywhere. \n\nAs far as things to do, here goes:\nFirst, leave your car, put on walking shoes, bring a jacket or sweater, and take a bus or taxi to Chinatown. Have lunch or dim sum in Chinatown (try Hunan Home at 622 Jackson) and wander through the shops and grocery markets (fresh frogs and dried who-knows-what for sale!) on Grant street there. There is a good playground a block from the main Chinatown street. Plan a couple hours for Chinatown. Then get coffee/cocoa or a meal at an outdoor cafe in nearby North Beach (Italian district) along Columbus street. While there you can climb the big hill up to Coit Tower for fabulous views of the city and the Bay. And then wander back toward the wharf to explore. When hunger strikes get crab or clam chowder in a sourdough bowl from the open sidewalk vendors to eat at the outdoor tables or do a fancy sit down meal at Scoma's. It is great to walk up and down the wharf along the Bay for the views, shops, and lots of things to do. Including a submarine tour or maritime museum or whatever your group is most interested in. Be sure to get ice cream with chocolate fudge at Ghirardelli and check out the mini chocolate factory museum inside the shop while you wait for them to fill your order. The line is long but it moves fast and is worth the wait. That's a classic SF day right there. Can be touristy but always fun. \n\nSecond, my favorite thing for 6-12 year olds is the Exploratorium, which is a hands-on science museum right on the waterfront. It was recently renovated and is super fun for parents too. You could easily do that for 3 hours. There's a cafe there for lunch or you can go gourmet at the nearby Ferry Building market. \n\nThird favorite is the Alcatraz island prison tour. Tickets sell out long in advance for that so book now online. Take water & snacks in a backpack and plan for the afternoon. You walk right through the old prison building with headphones in a guided tour that has voices of the actual prisoners. It is always a cool experience for all ages. \n\nIf you have more time, there's the cold but beautiful Pacific Ocean accessible at Ocean Beach, Golden Gate Park (Japanese gardens, great science museum and rowboats on Stow Lake), SF Zoo, and riding the cable cars (get a day pass and get on at a mid-town stop instead of waiting with the tourists at the end of the line), renting bikes, or taking the ferry to Sausalito or Angel Island. \n\nAhh, so little time to see it all. Hope this helps! �"

"Places To Go/Things To Do","Amelia Earhart Park's popular ''Tom Sawyer's Play Island''","For Immediate Release: \n February 02, 2015 \n\nMedia Contact: \n Laura Phillips\nlaf@miamidade.gov\n 305-755-7842 \n\nDesigned to inspire kids to be active in the outdoors, Amelia Earhart Park's popular ''Tom Sawyer's Play Island'' receives impressive creative makeover\n\n(MIAMI, February 2, 2015) - A fort-style tree house with climbers, spinners, slides, balance beams, swings, and musical instruments to play are part of the new playground amenities set to debut at Tom Sawyer’s Play Island at Amelia Earhart Park, located at 401 E. 65 Street in Hialeah. The playground area is approximately 7,500 square feet, making it the largest playground in the Miami-Dade County Parks system. Residents are invited to join the Miami-Dade County Parks, Recreation and Open Spaces Department and Miami-Dade County District 13 Commissioner Esteban Bovo Jr. for the grand opening and dedication ceremonies taking place on Saturday, February 7, 2015 at 10:00 a.m.\n\nThe playground is designed for children ages 2-12 and is fully accessible for all-inclusive play. Existing amenities at this site include a canopy of mature Live Oaks, natural boulders and a walk-through cave.\n\nThe Parks Department, in conjunction with contractors HG Construction and No Fault Industries, recently completed the playground improvement project, replacing older playground equipment. Other upgrades included improvements to the island’s landscaping, pavilion and fencing, and the installation of new flooring in the cave. The project cost was approximately $500,000 and was funded by the “Building Better Communities” General Obligation Bond Program (BBC-GOB).\n\n“This is very exciting news for Amelia Earhart Park and the many Miami-Dade residents and visitors that look to this park for quality health-minded recreation with their families,” said Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez.  “Playgrounds like this are inspiring kids to get outdoors and be active.” \n \n“I am delighted to see the new and improved Tom Sawyer Play Island Playground,” said Commissioner Bovo. “These new playground facilities were much needed and much deserved. I highly encourage residents to bring their children here for regular visits and experience all that this beautiful park has to offer.”\n\n“This new development is a great example of our commitment to providing diverse recreational options that are fun and offer adventure, while helping to improve the health and wellness of park users,” said Miami-Dade County Parks Director Jack Kardys.  “Creative playgrounds like this one inspire kids to play outside and be active.”\n\nThe 515-acre Amelia Earhart Park also features five crystal  blue lakes, picnic facilities, a children’s playground, an 18-hole disc golf course, a five-acre fenced dog park, a mountain-bike trail, and a new multi-use recreational pathway with a bike wash station that opened in October. In addition, the park is home to the Bill Gram Farm Village, Miami Wakeboarding Complex and Soccer 5 Soccer Complex.\n\nFor directions and information about recreational activities at Amelia Earhart Park visit www.miamidade.gov or call 305-685-8389.\n\nAbout the Miami-Dade County Parks, Recreation and Open Spaces Department  \nNationally accredited, a three-time winner of the NRPA National Gold Medal Award, winner of the 2013 Florida Governor’s Sustained Excellence Award and the 2009 Florida Governor’s Sterling Award for excellence in management and operations, Miami-Dade County Parks is the third largest county park system in the United States, consisting of 260 parks and 12,825 acres of land.

FoTaxi charges a flat rate by Zone and provides a coupon for a discount on the return trip.  Depending on your destination the fare into Budapest is between 4,000 Ft and 7,000 Ft. (Ft or HUF is the Hungarian currency. 1 USD = 227 HUF, 07/2014)  As you exit the secure area of the airport you will see the Taxi kiosk.  The person manning the kiosk generally speaks very good English.  Departing the Budapest Airport is convenient as the distance from the Security Doors to the curb is something less than 30 meters.\n\nSHUTTLE BUS:  The Budapest Airport operates a ‘shuttle service’ called ‘Airport Minibus’. Passengers are taken to the previously requested address by microbuses with eight to eleven seats. Guests who use the Minibus can get flight information during the journey.  Drivers speak English.  Fares to the area of Budapest that most tourists will be going is 3,200 ft (5,500 ft round trip) for one passenger, 4,790 ft (8,790 ft round trip) for two passengers and 5,990 ft (10,990 ft round trip) for three passengers.  As compared to the airport taxi, this is much less expensive for one passenger, marginally less expensive for two passengers and more expensive for three passengers.  You will share the shuttle with other passengers and the shuttle may make multiple stops in route to your hotel.\n\nTRAIN:  From Ferihegy Terminal 1 there is train service to Budapest Nyugati Railway Station. Upon arrival in Terminal 1 you can buy their tickets at Tourinform from 08.00 to 22.00.  In Budapest you can purchase the tickets at Platform B from the ticket vending machine.  The two platforms of the railway station are connected to the Airport Terminal 1 with a pedestrian footbridge.  Use Bus 200E to get from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1.  Train tickets are 370 ft from Ferihegy to the NYugati Pu. (train station). \n \nBUS:  Bus 200 connects Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 to the Köbánya-Kispest metro terminal and Bus 93 operates from Terminal 1 to Kőbánya-Kispest Metro Station. From the Metro Station the 'blue’ No. 3 Metro connects to the rest of Budapest.  The one-way single-ticket costs 350 ft [450 ft when buying on the bus from the driver on bus 200E].\n\n IMPORTANT!  Terminal 1 of Budapest Airport is now closed. If you want to take the train you should take the bus first from Terminal 2."

The little ball of butter on top of the pancakes are sweetened to complement the pancake. I wanted more than just pancakes so I also ordered two eggs, hash browns, and sausage patty a-la-cart. The sausage patty is the best I’ve ever had. I don’t know what seasonings are in it but it was incredible. The wait can be kind of long during the peak hours but well worth it!"

In the Litchfield Hills — just a two-hour drive from Manhattan — there are two amazing vineyards to visit, Haight-Brown and Hopkins. We are slightly obsessed with Haight-Brown's chocolate-and-cheese pairings for their wine selections. And, if you happen to visit the Litchfield Hills on a temperate weekend, we highly recommend a stop by Topsmead State Forest. Come spring, it's wildflowers for days."

"Places to go","Apache Trail","The majority of the trail is unpaved but can be easily driven by most vehicles. The trail features volcanic debris, cliff-sided canyons, sparkling lakes, towering saguaro cacti and a vast array of wildflowers. The mountains are generally uninhabited, so take along plenty of water.\nThe ghost town of Goldfield, the Old Western town of Tortilla Flat (population 6), the Boyce-Thompson Arboretum, Tonto National Monument and Weavers Needle Lookout are a few interesting points along the trail. Other scenic stops include The Lost Dutchman State Park (perhaps you can find the legendary lost gold mine) and Roosevelt Dam.\nThe Apache Trail is a four-hour round trip from Phoenix. Directions: Leave Phoenix via U.S. 60 east to the Apache Trail. Turn left on Arizona Highway 88 to the Apache Trail. After passing Roosevelt Dam and Tonto National Monument, make the return loop to Phoenix via U.S. 60."

Yep, they’ll organize everything your heart desires, from a waiter sabering a bottle of champagne on your terrace at sunset to bespoke fireworks. \n\nWhat to do: View the majestic Mount Otemanu, which towers above the main island, by bike or by boat, then explore the inner lagoon via submarine or with diving equipment."
"Places I Want to Visit","Maldives","http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/worlds-best-honeymoon-destinations-for-2014#!4-maldives\n\nThe islands of the Maldives are quintessential honeymoon destinations with deserted beaches that vie for the title “most romantic spot in the world.” This archipelago of dozens of atolls and more than 1,100 coral islands span 35,000 square feet of the Indian Ocean and is located about 500 miles southwest of Sri Lanka. The Maldives are truly one of the last unspoiled island getaways in the world. \n\nIt’s hard to get there—get ready for a long-haul flight from the United States plus either a seaplane or boat transfer from the international airport—but the effort is rewarded with picture-perfect sunsets, wide beaches, and some of the best diving and snorkeling in the world. This is the place to interact with whale sharks, manta rays, reef sharks, sea turtles, and an array of colorful fish and sea creatures. Resorts are confined to their own islands so you won’t flit from place to place after you arrive. Almost all of the resorts are firmly in the “luxury” category. This is the place to book a beach villa or overwater bungalow.\n\nWhere to Stay: Every island resort is unique so you are bound to find one that fits your vacation style. Consider Per Aquum’s Huvafen Fushi with its underwater spa on the North Male Atoll or Niyama on Dhaalu Atoll. Other popular resorts include Taj Exotica Maldives known for the best cuisine in the South Male Atoll, Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru (North Male Atoll), and Angsana Valavaru (Dhaalu Atoll).\n\nPerfect for Couples Who: Love deserted island escapes. Spend your time lazing on the beach, swimming, snorkeling, diving, and enjoying Maldivian sunrises and sunsets.\n\nPhoto from Guardian article on the Maldives: http://goo.gl/jM4XQK"

Some of the most popular places to visit in Panama include the Panama Canal and the Bocas del Toro islands on the Caribbean coast. Panama is a relatively unexplored country, which means the chances of happening on a secret beach or secret waterfall in this country are great."

The stairs lead to the Sancta Sanctorum (English: Holy of Holies), the personal chapel of the early Popes known as the chapel of St. Lawrence.\n\nAccording to the Catholic tradition, they are the steps leading up to the praetorium of Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem on which Jesus Christ stepped on his way to trial during the events known as the Passion.[2] The stairs were, reputedly, brought to Rome by St. Helena in the fourth century. For centuries, the Scala Santa has attracted Christian pilgrims who wish to honor the Passion of Jesus.\n\nItalian to English\nspigola = sea bass\nCream = panna.\nzucchero = white sugar\nzucchero di canna = brown sugar\nAcqua = Water\nAcqua natural(or liscia) = Still water\nAcqua frizzante = Sparkling water\nAcqua da’rubinetto = Tap water"

The bar owners and regulars have named it “El DJ” and there is even an entire page of the bar’s website dedicated to this automated disc jockey. Even though this isn’t a traditional jukebox with movie parts, El DJ is a powerhouse of tunes stocked with over 3,000 albums.

"Places I Want to Visit","Croatia","http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/worlds-best-honeymoon-destinations-for-2014#!11-croatia\n\nIf you love the Mediterranean but are tired of the crowds, it’s time to visit Croatia. While it’s gaining in popularity, peak vacation periods are not nearly as frenetic as their neighbors across the Adriatic. One of the best ways to explore the Dalmatian Coast is via cruise ship. You’ll call upon places like the city of Dubrovnik, which has been a bustling seaport since the 7th century; the island of Korcula, where you can bike, snorkel, or kayak; Split with the breathtaking Diocletian’s Palace—now a UNESCO World Heritage site—that was built in 305 AD; the fishing port of Rovinj; and the quaint island of Hvar with its beaches, lavender fields, groves of olive trees, pine forests, fruit orchards, and vineyards.\n\nWhere to Stay: There is no better way to get acquainted with Croatia than via cruise ship. Try the 694-passenger Azamara Quest, which sails a 7-night round-trip itinerary from Venice that calls upon Zadar, Split, Hvar, and Dubrovnik in Croatia plus Montenegro’s Kotor. Tere Moana, the intimate 90-guest ship from Paul Gauguin Cruises also sails round-trip from Venice with calls on Sibenik, Trogir, Split, Korcula, Dubrovnik, Hvar, and Rovinj. SeaDream Yacht Club’s 112-guest SeaDream II comes to the table with a Dubrovnik to Venice 7-night cruise that calls on Korcula, Hvar, Sibenik, Rab, Pula, and Piran.\n\nPerfect for Couples Who: Want a mix of Old Europe and a traditional Mediterranean cruise that offers plenty of beach time."

"Places to visit (Prague, cz)","Танцующий фонтан","«Чешские музыканты» (Čeští muzikanti или Tančící kašna) — один из самых чудесных танцующих фонтанов Праги. Он расположен практически в самом центре города, на Сеноважной площади (по-чешски — Senovážné náměstí). Даже среди многих и многих фонтанов Праги «Чешские музыканты» заметно выделяются. Дело в том, что этот шедевр сложно назвать просто фонтаном — это произведение скульптурного искусства! Вопреки привычным представлениям о фонтанах, этот этюд — не композиция струй воды, разлетающихся в разные стороны и составляющих общую зрелищную картину. Здесь же композиция струй формируется из нескольких потоков воды, бьющих прямо вверх. Казалось бы, так в чем же изюминка? Может, в разнице высот струй? Это, конечно, тоже важно, но главная особенность данного фонтана — его невероятное скульптурное оформление. Его оригинальные бронзовые скульптуры, представляющие людей в самых причудливых позах, выполнены с такой тщательностью, что поражают даже самое искушенное воображение.\n\nФонтан искусно оформлен композицией из четырех танцующих фигур. Они символизируют знаменитые реки всего мира: Амазонку, Дунай, Миссисипи и Ганг. Оригинальный сюжет этой композиции продолжен пятой фигурой, одиноко застывшей в отдаленном уголке сквера. Это олицетворение не менее значимой реки — Нила.\nВся эта композиция, поражающая воображение глубиной символов, несомненно стоит того, чтобы отправиться на Senovážné náměstí, на остановку Jindřišská. Добраться туда несложно: вам подойдут трамваи с номерами 3, 9, 14, 24, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 58, 91. Желаем вам хорошего путешествия и ярких эмоций!"

Сковороды, 7а\n\nАрт-кофейня «Vagabond» — чудо-место с интересной концепцией, где посетителей рассчитывает не официант, а они сами оставляют деньги в специально отведённом месте. На барной стойке для этого стоит большая банка. Цены здесь умеренные, напиток с десертом или сэндвичем обойдётся вам около 60-70 грн. Кофейню можно смело назвать американской, ведь даже один из владельцев и часть персонала из США.\n«Vagabond» радует киевлян не только вкусными кофейными напитками, милкшейками и смузи, но и свежей домашней выпечкой. Несмотря на то, что в кофейне всего 3 столика, она  очень уютная, а раритетные книги, лампы и картины удачно дополняют интерьер и способствуют созданию творческой атмосферы.  В летнее время для посетителей выставляют дополнительные столики на улице.\n\nСтоит отметить, что персонал здесь очень весёлый и общительный. Официанты легко находят общий язык с гостями, иногда дождливыми вечерами угощают всех вином и сэндвичами. Здесь часто отдыхают творческие люди, и, если повезет, можно попасть на выступление какого-нибудь музыканта или поэта. А каждую пятницу в кофейне устраиваются музыкальные посиделки.\n\nПоэтому если вы открыты для новых идей, ищете вдохновение или просто хотите хорошо провести вечер — обязательно посетите это место!"

"Places to travel (Lviv, ua)","Львівський Оперний театр","Львівський Оперний театр – архітектурна перлина Львова у стилі неоренесансу (1901 рік), один з найгарніших театрів Європи.\n\nЗбудований на початку минулого століття за проектом архітектора Зиґмунта Ґорґолевського Великий театр у Львові порівнювали з Паризькою та Віденською оперою. Стоячи перед величним фасадом цієї фантастичної споруди відчуваєш всепоглинаючу потугу мистецтва, його вічність у контрасті зі швидкоплинністю людського життя. Це споруда, у якій можна знайти різні архітектурні стилі європейських країн, втілені з пишномовною імпозантністю.\n\nФорми фасаду дуже складні і різноманітні: це колони, балюстради, ніші, насичені алегоричними скульптурними постатями. Над головним карнизом фасаду височать статуї восьми муз, над ними горельєфна десятифігурна композиція «Радощі і страждання життя». Фронтон угорі завершується скульптурною тріадою крилатих бронзових постатей Генія драми і комедії, трагедії і у центрі – Слави, яка тримає золоту пальмову гілку. Ці скульптури творили видатні львівські митці Попель, Баронч, Війтович.\n\nІнтер’єр львівської опери вражає не менше, ніж зовнішній вигляд. Внутрішнє убранство споруди оздоблене позолотою (на неї витратили декілька кілограмів золота), різнокольоровим мармуром, декоративними розписами і скульптурою. Чотириярусний глядацький зал має форму ліри і вміщує понад тисячу людей. Окрасою сцени є декоративна завіса «Парнас» (1900 рік) відомого у Європі живописця Генрика Семирадського – алегоричне трактування сенсу людського життя у постатях Парнасу.\n\nЗал львівського оперного театру відзначається чудовою акустикою. Тут можна побачити виступи славетних оперних і балетних колективів України та гастролерів з інших країн. У львівській опері проводять нещодавно відроджені Віденські бали."
"Places to travel (Lviv, ua)","Кафе ""Мазох""","Самым экстравагантным заведением Львова, известным далеко за его пределами есть знаменитое кафе «Мазох». Разместилась эта неординарная кнайпа в самом центре города (по соседству с шоколадной фабрикой) на улице Сербская, 7. В оформлении заведения воспроизведено интимную атмосферу деятельности известного поэта Леопольда фон Захер-Мазоха, который родился, жил и творил во Львове, и на основании его работ возникло новое направление в психиатрии, названное «мазохизмом». Кухня ресторана полностью соответствует его тематике, а названия блюд и коктейлей способны пробудить аппетит и фантазию каждого ценителя острых ощущений."

With glittering lakes, the country’s only bona fide forest and moody mist-ringed mountains, it’s no wonder 19th-century Romantics like poet William Wordsworth flocked here for inspiration. \nWhere to stay: Hidden at the end of a road is Lakefield Boathouse (from $1,700 for a 7-night stay, LakefieldBoathouse.com), a cozy B&B on Britain’s second-largest lake, complete with a private shoreline. Take the property’s rowboat out for a romantic afternoon paddle."

Именно с таких слов началось мое знакомство с шеф-поваром и по совместительству владельцем заведения «Revolution Grill» Женей.\nИдея «революции на гриле» (именно так по смыслу переводится название «Revolution Grill») родилась у Жени в феврале прошлого года, когда во время революции на Майдане Независимости он готовил мясо в условиях, которые очень отдаленно напоминали ресторан.\nРеволюционное настроение Женя решил излить в бизнес и 26 декабря 2014 года открыл американскую столовую в центре Киева. С огромным витком трудностей пришлось столкнуться, но спустя некоторое время ресторан все-таки открыл свои двери.\n\n“Must visit”: Кофейбус – маленькая кофейня большого города «Зеваки, проходящие мимо заведения, всматриваются в окна.

So seeing one of our restaurants -- ANY of our restaurants -- on national TV was kind of a huge deal. (Flash forward a few years and Detroiters would become a bit less enthusiastic about Bourdainian coverage.) Polonia is an old Polish restaurant among quite a few other old Polish restaurants in the once predominantly Polish Hamtramck, and while everyone has a favorite (with all respect to Polish Village Café and the Polish Yacht Club), Polonia is arguably the most famous."

"Places to visit (Prague, cz)","Скульптура «Ласточка» (Socha «Vlaštovka»)","Столица Чехии богата многими интересными и нестандартными достопримечательностями. В Праге множество замков средневекового вида и невероятных скульптур и памятников авторов современности, аналогов которых вы не встретите нигде.\nКлементинум — комплекс старинных зданий Праги стал настоящим родителем для небольшого, но интересного современного памятника – скульптуре Магдалены Поплавской «Vlaštovka — Влаштьовка (Ласточка)».\n\nУ этой скульптуры простая, но вместе с тем трогательная история. Все произошло словно в сказке.\n\nВ одном из самых красивых и старых замков Клементинума проводилась выставка работ студентов художественно-промышленной школы Праги. На ней были представлены работы, среди которых была скульптура Магдалены Поплавской. Это была статуя в виде сидящей маленькой девочки, в руках которой фигурка, сложенная из бумаги.\n\nПосетители видели в ее руках то ли журавлика, то ли самолетик, то ли ласточку.\n\nПосле экспозиции студенты забрали работы, а девочка осталась забытой. После выставки скульптура прижилась в замке на многие годы. Потом пластиковую девочку посадили на крышу постройки комплекса Клементинум, и она и сегодня сидит, свесив свои ножки, и будто следит за прохожими и собирается запустить в них фигурку, которую держит в руках.\nСуществует и другая версия: люди рассказывают, что исполнительница работы вернулась и забрала скульптуру, но она настолько понравилась пражанам, что они потребовали вернуть её, и девочка снова вернулась в Клементинум.\n\nТуристы, которые смотрят на девочку на крыше, часто путают её с настоящим ребенком. Нередко можно услышать возгласы и размышления о том, как маленькая девочка попала на такую высоту.\n\nИ сегодня никто так точно и не может сказать, что за фигурка в руках ребенка.

И уже через полтора месяца появились первые украинские страусята. Сегодня поголовье ясногородских страусов составляет более 200.\n\nПосле экскурсии по страусиной ферме, можете отправиться в мини-зоопарк. Здесь можно покататься на верблюдах или осликах. Для детей оборудована отдельная площадка, имеются надувные горки и веломопеды. Если любите пострелять - можно проверить свою меткость в тире.\n\nНа территории страусиной фермы есть экзотический ресторан. Здесь предлагают отведать блюда из страусиного мяса и яиц.\n\nТакже в различные времена года страусиная ферма - платформа для разных фестивалей. В мае-июне здесь проходит фестиваль птенцов, в августе - фестиваль страусов.\n\nАдрес: Украина, Киевская область, Макаровский район, с. Ясногородка, ул. Подлесная, 32.

Everything on the menu is great and the gravy is freaking awesome! The Universal has homemade sausage patties and potatoes. My recommendation – The blueberry pancakes. Keep in mind they are gigantic. I had one and it was plenty. The outside was crispy while the inside was custard/soft like. Served w/ warm syrup. Very “made from scratch” kinda taste and consistency. You can tell they care about the quality of the dishes. Food is served hot and portions are just right. Service was excellent and friendly. Fun atmosphere as well. To top everything off I had a delicious grapefruit mimosa. I feel this is a going to become my new weekly choice."

"Places to Visit","harriman state park #alice","From NYC To Harriman State Park: Public Transportation\nbear mountain bridge from the timp in harriman state park\nBear Mt. Bridge from The Timp\nThe trouble for me with living in New York City is that I don't have a car, so getting out of the city for a weekend trip into the wilderness can necessitate rather out of the way transportation routes. There are websites that mention that access to state parks is possible, but none that I have seen explains in any detail how to do so. In this post, I will outline getting to and from Harriman State Park in New York.\n\nThe park is vast and takes at least two days to hike through. There are routes that traverse the mountains from east to west, and these are the most accessible by public transportation. The park does expand quite far south, but the lack of trains and buses in that part make exploring those regions untenable unless one wishes to backtrack.\n\nThe easiest way to access the park is via the Short Line bus that departs from the Port Authority Bus Terminal on the west side of Midtown Manhattan. If you wish to start on the west side of the park, take the Middletown, NY bound bus to the Arden stop on route 17. This stop is, seemingly, in the middle of nowhere, but it provides direct access to the Appalachian Trail via the Elk Pen area just up the road to the east. For access to the east side, take the West Point bound bus to the Bear Mountain stop. This will drop you off just outside the Bear Mountain Inn with direct access to several trails, including the Appalachian Trail.\n\nThe most difficult part of hiking Harriman State Park is the return trip to NYC. On a multi-day backpacking hike, it's difficult to know what time you will exit the park. The way I suggest planning the hike is to start at Bear Mountain, hike through the park, and instead of hiking to the Appalachian Trail intersection at Elk Pen, take the Ramapo-Dunderberg trail south (just past the Fingerboard shelter), then take the yellow and white trails toward Southfields. Southfields is a better choice to catch the bus back to the city because it is better lit, has amenities like a gas station (junk food is a nice reward after a long, two day hike) and a motel.\n\nmap of west side of harriman state park, nynjtc.org\nMap of the west side of Harriman (purchase at nynjtc.org)\n\n\nThe white trail that leads down a hill to interstate 87 where the trail makes a left turn south and parallels the highway. After a short walk, you come to a pedestrian bridge over the highway. Take this bridge, and when you reach the other side, take a left turn, walk a short distance, then follow the white blazes right (west) toward a creek. There is a metal bridge that takes you over the creek, but it has been severely damaged by hurricane Irene. It is still passable with extreme caution as many of the boards are missing and there are no stairs the other side of the bridge.\n\nbroken bridge at southfields\nUse extreme caution traversing the bridge to Southfields\n\nThe trail then leads toward the town. It intersects with an active railroad line. I suggest taking a left (south) turn here and walking along the tracks (carefully, trains running northbound) until you arrive at Railroad Ave. Cut through to the road, then climb the hill to route 17. Take a left (south) on route 17 toward the Valero gas station. Treat yourself to a snack and a drink, then check the return bus schedule to NYC.\n\nhttp://noelbenford.com/2012/03/from-nyc-to-harriman-state-park-public.html\n\n\nThe hardest part of the entire trip is not climbing the mountains, it's flagging down the speeding bus. There are no signs indicating where you should stand. My suggestion is standing by the north side of the yellow concrete box with shrubs in it just outside the Tuxedo Motel, and when you see the bus coming, wave your hands like mad. You will have to pay the bus driver in cash.\n\nThis last weekend, the bus sped right by me at 60 mph (in a 30 mph zone) and I was left outside in the freezing cold with 2 hours until the next bus, which may or may not see me. This is why Arden is a poor choice to catch the bus back and Southfields is superior because Southfields has the Tuxedo Motel. For $50 a night, including tax, you get a decent room, plenty good enough for the weary hiker. The man I met at the front desk was incredibly friendly, and I highly recommend this motel.\n\nAfter spending the night at the hotel, flagging the bus in the light the next morning was easier. Just make sure you have enough money to spend the night in case you reach Southfields at night when it's cold. Either that, or plan to camp out at the gas station!\nPosted 12th March 2012 by Noel Benford\nLocation: Harriman State Park, Harriman, NY 10926, USA"

My parents did this road trip in the 80s and they said it was a trip of a lifetime. Picnics, staying at cute little pensions, unbelievable scenery, Roman ruins, Medieval fortresses, prehistoric sites -- this is France!!!\n\n\n"

"Places to visit (Kiev, ua)","Ландшафтный парк в селе Буки Киевской области","Так уж сложилось, что в Киевской области есть тезка села Черкасской области. В селе Буки на Киевщине расположен красивый ландшафтный парк. Он был основан в 1996 году предпринимателем Иваном Сусловым, владельцем агропромышленной корпорации «Сквира». Для парка он выкупил участок земли возле реки Роставица. Земля площадью 2,7 гектара была местной свалкой и обошлась всего в $20 000.\n\nПарк состоит из двух частей: храмового комплекса с фонтаном и самого ландшафтного парка. Вход на территорию бесплатный. Однако в некоторые части парка можно попасть только с экскурсоводом.\n\nВо время экскурсии вы сможете узнать много интересной информации, увидеть Поляну сказок с очень красивыми сказочными фигурами и мини-зоопарк, где живут лев, медведи, олени, волчата, страус и другие животные.\n\nДля строительства храмового комплекса и проектирования парка был приглашен архитектор Юрий Бабич. Несмотря на то, что он уже был достаточно известен, этот комплекс, вероятно, самая значимая его работа, за которую он получил государственную премию. Отдельные элементы были изменены самим Иваном Сусловым, как, например, крыши по бокам храма в виде огромных голубей.\n\nКомплекс включает в себя колокольню Святого Даниила, названную в честь Даниила Кучмы, отца президента Украины. В одно время сын Ивана Суслова заболел раком. Необходимых лекарств в Украине не было. Иван Николаевич не знал, что делать, и попытался попросить помощи у Леонида Кучмы, но его отказались принять. Тогда он попробовал пройти силой, охрана остановила его и сообщила об этом инциденте президенту. На следующий день лекарства были доставлены специальным рейсом из Германии, и сын был спасен. Колокольня была названа в честь отца, который дал жизнь Леониду Кучме. После оранжевой революции предпринимателю предложили убрать табличку с названием колокольни, но он отказался.\n\nКиевляне наверняка помнят фонтан, стоявший на Майдане Независимости до реконструкции. После реконструкции площади в 2001 году разобранный фонтан много лет пылился на одном из столичных складов и его детали потихоньку растаскивали. Иван Суслов организовал транспортировку фонтана в село Буки, где его два года ремонтировали. Несколько металлических лепестков чаши были отлиты заново, заменено насосное оборудование и гранит, установлено дополнительное освещение. В 2011 году фонтан был открыт и отныне он встречает гостей у входа в парк."

"Places I Want to Visit","Belize","http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/worlds-best-honeymoon-destinations-for-2014#!7-belize\n\nLocated in Central America, Belize is an incredibly compelling honeymoon destination for three simple reasons: its close proximity to the United States (a two-hour flight from Miami), its weather (around 84 degrees daily year-round), and the 190-mile-long Belize Barrier Reef. The reef is easily accessible along the coast and is wildly popular for snorkeling and scuba trips, fishing excursions, and romantic sunset cruises. \n\nThe country is hemmed in by the Caribbean Sea on the east, Guatemala to the west, and Mexico in the north. In addition to the Belize Barrier Reef, the country is gifted with pristine beaches, jungle and rainforests, and ruins dating back to the Mayan period. Belize attracts a variety of honeymooners, from nature-lovers to history buffs to diving fanatics to those who simply prefer to sit on the beach at their resort with drink in hand.\n\nWhere to Stay: If water adventures aren’t your thing but you’d still love to honeymoon in Belize, head to Ka’ana Resort in the western part of the country. This inland boutique resort is located in a valley in the Maya Mountains in the Cayo District. Luxurious 1,250-square-foot, one-bedroom private pool villas offer the best of indoor/outdoor living and are ideal for romantic getaways. From the resort, you can enjoy day trips to the Tapir Mountain Nature Reserve; Maya ruins like Tikal, Zunantunichm, and Caracol; Barton Creek Cave for kayaking; horseback riding along the bank of the Mopan River; or go jaguar tracking or bird-watching with expert naturalists and guides.\n\nPerfect for Couples Who: Want an authentic and luxurious but eco-friendly experience that blends the country’s culture with outdoor activities like zip-lining and cave tubing."

Just saying or writing the words sends shivers of excitement down my spine. If you think I'm crazy, it's probably because you grew up in a country where road trips are taken for granted, and the number of places you can drive to and go to are endless. To me, road trips are fun and exciting no matter why I have to take them. Regardless of how you feel about them, it's always good to prepare before you embark on one."

Считается, что он был построен в 10-м веке, чтобы стать убежищем для мифической принцессы. Этот обширный комплекс является последним пристанищем некоторых самых выдающихся людей в мире, просто потому что за его массивными воротами расположен Собор Св. Петра и Павла, который построен в нео-готическом стиле — шедевр истории и аутентичности. Можно сидеть на крепостной стене с видом на реку Влтавы и наслаждаться волшебным закатом, вдыхая тот же волшебный воздух, что и великие чехи — Карел Чапек и Бедржих Сметана  похоронены здесь. В Вышеграде находится старейшее здание Праги, которое еще сохранилось — Ротонда святого Мартина."

It's beautiful and pretty consistent waves, have some good local connections for places to stay and the area has amazing food.  The trip flies you into Liberia and the drive is relatively easy out to the coast.  Definitely better than going into San Jose.  You are Seriously taking your life into your own hands driving out to the pacific coast from there, would not recommend it.  Let me know if you think you want more info.  The friend of ours who lives there is from Park City and has been there for years and years. Good access to the coast from North to south of there and now more than ever is more developed, even though the roads are not paved and rainy season can get tricky.  \nKeep us posted,\nxoxo Sylvia and Rob"

Это искусственный курган, насыпанный в 1869 – 1900 годах польской общиной города в честь 300-летия Люблинской унии. \nКроме этого, Замковая гора или гора «Высокий Замок» являет собой комплекс памятников: парк «Высокий Замок», основанный в 1835 году; городище древнерусского города Львова (памятник археологии национального значения); грот и скульптуры львов (памятники архитектуры национального значения), и остатки Высокого замка, который был построен в XIII в. под руководством галицко-волынского князя Льва на Замковой горе. Замок, повторяющий контуры вершины горы, по плану имел форму вытянутого прямоугольника с четырьмя башнями по углам. Уже в конце XIII – начале XIV века замок перестраивается в камне. Заложение каменного, так называемого Высокого замка, в 1362 году по традиции приписывается польскому королю Казимиру III, захватившему Галицкую Русь. В 1869 году практически полностью уничтоженные остатки старой крепости были разобраны. Сохранился лишь фрагмент южной каменной стены с бойницами, которая ограждала въезд на территорию замка.\nАдрес: Парк «Высокий замок» - ул. М. Кривоноса"

"Places","band (456 N. Perry Parkway, Oregon","Hello Band Parents -  Saturday is the big Solo & Ensemble Festival at Oregon High School.  Here are a couple notes to help your musician have a great day.\n\n1. Students should arrive at Oregon High School (456 N. Perry Parkway, Oregon) no later than 30 minutes before their first performance time.\n2. Students should dress up but be aware of comfortable shoes for walking.\n3. Students will need to transport their own instrument and bring all music including an original copy of their music with their measures numbered.  Students need to bring their instrument/music home on Thursday or Friday.  No teachers will be at MHS on Saturday morning.  If students forget something, they will need to find (and be super nice to) the custodian on duty asking them to open the band room. (not an ideal process).\n4. Coats and cases can be left in the OHS field house.\n5. Lunch will be available in their cafeteria.  Students should bring $ if they are staying over lunch.\n6. Parents, friends and families are encouraged to come hear the performances.\n\nAttached to this email is a complete MHS listing of events sorted by time.  There are quite a few listed, so you might want to check with your student.  They should know their performance time(s).\n\nIt is always great hearing how our students improve over the preparation time for festival.  Preparing for this definitely helps all participants grow musically.  Though there will be the inevitable excitement and disappointments about ratings, please help us reinforce that all students are already winners by simply taking on this challenge.  \n\nThanks…   Brad and Mike\n"

"Places to travel (Lviv, ua)","Палац Потоцьких","Палац графів Потоцьких – велична будівля у стилі французького неоренесансу кінця XIX століття.\n\nЗа огорожею з орнаментальною металевою брамою бачимо величну і водночас витончену споруду. Імпозантний палац прикрашений рельєфами, ліпниною, настінним живописом і вітражами. Палац Потоцьких – яскравий зразок архiтектури зрiлого iсторизму, одна з найцiкавiших архiтектурних пам’яток Львова. Запроектував його французький архiтектор Луї д'Оверню на замовлення намiсника королiвства Галичини і Лодомерiї графа Альфреда II Юзефа Потоцького (1817-1889). Будівництво тривало від 1888 до 1890 року пiд наглядом та деякою коректурою львівського архiтектора Юліана Цибульського. \n\nІнтер’єри палацу на першому поверсi вирiшенi здебільшого у стилi короля Луї XVI. Зали (Червона, Дзеркальна, Голуба, Кабiнет Ордината) оздоблені штучним мармуром i позолотою, ліпниною та дзеркалами. Рiзьбленi з мармуру каміни прикрашені золоченою бронзою. \n\nНа першому поверсі міститься каплиця з чудотворною іконою Львівської Богородиці (XV ст.). Експозицiя Львiвської галереї мистецтв розгорнута на другому поверсi. Її вiдкриває зал античного мистецтва. Європейське мистецтво XIV-XVIII ст. представлене найкращими творами збірки: українською іконою XV ст. «Св. Параскевою», полотнами М. Базаїтi, Я. Цуккi, С. Рiччi, Ж.-Е. Лiотара, Ж. Герена, Ф. Гойї. Часто у палаці відбуваються конференції, презентації, камерні концерти, зустрічі політиків."

"Places to eat","GoBistro, 1111 Broadway, 720-536-5689","“GoBistro is the convergence of convenience, healthy, and delicious,” co-owner Colleen Eager says. She and Mike Keuler (formally an Olympic ski jumper) both worked at Whole Foods so you can believe they take GoBistro’s “real food, real easy” slogan to heart.\n\nSwing by the five-week-old storefront in the Metlo on Broadway and find two refrigerators stocked with nutrient-dense grab-and-go dishes. The breakfast burrito—Eager calls it the Fuel Cell—is jammed with scrambled eggs, chipotle-roasted sweet potato, black beans, corn and queso fresco. Warm it up, dip it in the house-made green chile, and you’re enjoying a meal packed with protein, dietary fiber, and vitamins A and C—and it’s crave-able good. Same goes for the roasted beet salad (with quinoa and citrus vinaigrette) and the steak lettuce wraps (one of the ever-changing specials). Even better, you can ask for GoBistro’s dishes to be delivered to your doorstep."

"Places You Must Go","Belize","http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/worlds-best-honeymoon-destinations-for-2014#!7-belize\n\nLocated in Central America, Belize is an incredibly compelling honeymoon destination for three simple reasons: its close proximity to the United States (a two-hour flight from Miami), its weather (around 84 degrees daily year-round), and the 190-mile-long Belize Barrier Reef. The reef is easily accessible along the coast and is wildly popular for snorkeling and scuba trips, fishing excursions, and romantic sunset cruises. \n\nThe country is hemmed in by the Caribbean Sea on the east, Guatemala to the west, and Mexico in the north. In addition to the Belize Barrier Reef, the country is gifted with pristine beaches, jungle and rainforests, and ruins dating back to the Mayan period. Belize attracts a variety of honeymooners, from nature-lovers to history buffs to diving fanatics to those who simply prefer to sit on the beach at their resort with drink in hand.\n\nWhere to Stay: If water adventures aren’t your thing but you’d still love to honeymoon in Belize, head to Ka’ana Resort in the western part of the country. This inland boutique resort is located in a valley in the Maya Mountains in the Cayo District. Luxurious 1,250-square-foot, one-bedroom private pool villas offer the best of indoor/outdoor living and are ideal for romantic getaways. From the resort, you can enjoy day trips to the Tapir Mountain Nature Reserve; Maya ruins like Tikal, Zunantunichm, and Caracol; Barton Creek Cave for kayaking; horseback riding along the bank of the Mopan River; or go jaguar tracking or bird-watching with expert naturalists and guides.\n\nPerfect for Couples Who: Want an authentic and luxurious but eco-friendly experience that blends the country’s culture with outdoor activities like zip-lining and cave tubing."

To breadcrumbs dish, add panko, parmesan and parsley.\n\nLine a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Dip frozen cheese sticks in flour, shaking off excess, then into the egg, then coat with the crumbs. Repeat for each cheese stick, placing them on the lined baking sheet. Freeze on sheet at least 15 minutes, or until ready to bake (this is a must or they will melt before the crumbs get golden).\n\nWhen ready to bake, preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Arrange oven rack in the bottom third of your oven.\n\nBake 4 to 5 minutes, turn sticks over, and bake an additional 4-5 minutes, watching sticks closely so they don't melt.

J'ai pourtant tout fais dans leurs règles, enregistrement vocal, mail, mais il me font tourner en rond depuis un mois allant même jusqu'a mentir sur le fait qu'aucun enregistrement n'a été fait.\n\nJ'estime être dans mon droit car l'annulation a été faite le même jour de la réservation, j'ai en plus demandé a être remboursé par bon d'achat, cela ne change donc absolument rien financièrement pour cette société. Pourquoi m'avoir dis que l'annulation va être pris en charge immédiatement et que j'allais avoir mon bon d'achat sous 3 jours? Si au bout d'un mois, malgré mes relance d'appels ou de mail, ils en viennent à me mentir?\n\nSi mon dernier recours et de saisir un juge de proximité et porter plainte contre cette société je le ferrais, car je trouve ces manières absolument scandaleuses.\n\nMerci de m'aider sur ce point. \nhttp://forum.lesarnaques.com/compagnie-aerienne-sncf-autres/non-remboursement-bravofly-t207030.html"

There are only a few rules: don't hit anyone with a camera, don't hit anyone without a pillow, ensure your pillow has a case (pillows without one can cause scratching), and take your pillow afterwards.

No further explanation necessary.\nOrdered:\nAppetizers:\nDeej - Cabot clothbound cheddar, duck lardons, herb spaetzle, apple, swiss chard, date puree, cheddar cheese sauce. Maybe best dish she has ever had.\nRyan - various mushrooms, chestnut cavatelli (half moon shaped pasta), herb yogurt, roasted apple, galangal,malted chestnuts. Unique, earthy, amazing variety of textures.\nEntrees:\nDeej - braised pork (breaded, fried in cube shape), bacon jam stuffed matzo ball, young red kraut, purple cabbage mustard. Pork was moist but not super flavorful. Everything else really good.\nRyan - baked tilefish with brandade croquettes (mashed salted cod), potatoes, marcona almonds,capers, verjus vinaigrette, espuma (creamy foam). Everything worked perfectly together. Foam made the fish. Fish was delicate and buttery.\nDesserts:\nDeej - steamed chocolate cake, coconut mousse, shaved hazelnut, lime zest, chocolate pearls, cocoa nibs. Moist delicate cake, pearls tasted like high class cocoa puffs. \nRyan - honey pot. Milk and honey pudding, floral ice, macerated Asian pear, honey brittle, flower petals. So unique and delicious.\nDrinks:\nDeej - rye old fashioned. Rittenhouse rye, linie aquavit, simple syrup. Delicious. Strong but drinkable.\nService: by committee.

"Places You Must Go","New Zealand","http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/worlds-best-honeymoon-destinations-for-2014#!2-new-zealand-\n\nLand of the Long White Cloud, New Zealand tops Google’s list of trending honeymoon destinations and with good reason. If you and your honey enjoy active adventures in a natural setting, you’d be hard-pressed to find a more diverse destination. There are gorgeous beaches for swimming and sunbathing, freshwater lakes for fishing, fast-moving rivers for rafting, breathtaking fjords to explore, and mountains to climb. There’s even a region of active volcanoes. \n\nNew Zealand is also the only place on earth where you can see flightless birds like the kakapo and kiwi. The country—made up of North and South islands as well as a few smaller outer islands—may not be as populated as nearby Australia but it’s well developed and easy to get around by car. It’s a long haul to get there though: Air New Zealand flies direct from Los Angeles to Auckland. It’s a 13-hour trip.\n\nWhere to Stay: Located on 17 acres in Taupo in the central region of North Island Huka Lodge is the place to head for an outdoorsy yet decidedly upscale honeymoon. The compound, bordered by the Waikato River and Wairakei Park Reserve, offers opportunities for hiking, fishing, golfing, and day tours to White Island, Mt. Tarawere, Waitomo Caves, and other interesting spots. Within this natural setting you’ll also find luxury hotel standards like a swimming pool, hot tubs, and tennis court. The lodge is intimate with just 18 junior suites, the four-bedroom Owner’s Cottage, and the two-bedroom Alan Pye Cottage.\n\nPerfect for Couples Who: Enjoy active, outdoor adventures paired with a refined, luxury resort."

There also were other things to eat, but they were more expensive.(about £15 single course)\n Beef burger wasn't very big - but the taste was ok. It was served with fries in a pot, with ketchup and Mayo in two small pots. Fries were bad - thin and tasting too much of fried food. \nThe atmosphere is quite nice, with music, a bar, and soffuse?? Lights.\noverall score: 3/5. Good presentation, price ok, good idea for sharing plates. Soft drinks at £3, so beers might have been quite expensive. "

However, once you pay the airfare, less than $20 per day can buy you nice beaches, good surfing, nice scenery and a comfortable place to stay at night.

"Places to eat/do in Los Angeles","Dumpling restaurants in LA","Xiaolongbao @ Din Tai Fung\nThese tiny pockets of soup are Los Angeles' most treasured dumplings. Din Tai Fung, with a location in Arcadia and Glendale, is a worldwide chain from Taiwan that has developed quite a cult following. Xiaolong means small steaming basket and bao means bun. Prepare to wait to get a hold of these soup dumplings. We recommend the pork and crab version; it's the most traditional of the bunch. 1088 S Baldwin Ave, Arcadia, CA 91007.\n\nCantonese Wonton @ Sam Woo\nWontons, known as huntun in Mandarin, have many different variations depending on the region. The wonton wrapper is a little different from shuijiao wrappers in that it includes eggs and is folded differently. The skin is thinner than regular potstickers or boiled dumplings. Sam Woo has one of the best wonton noodle soups in Los Angeles. The wonton is stuffed with pork and shrimp, and it's served with egg noodles from Hong Kong and an intricate broth that takes days to make. 514 W Valley Blvd, Alhambra, CA 91803.\n\nChili Wonton @ Chengdu Taste\nChengdu Taste is undoubtedly Los Angeles' best Chinese restaurant right now. Chef Tony Xu is dedicated to bringing to life traditional Chinese recipes, and insists that his chefs read up on the history of Sichuan cuisine.The wontons are remarkably delicate, stuffed with ground pork, and are served over a bed of light chili oil and topped with a generous heaping of scallions. Yes, it's really spicy. 828 W Valley Blvd, Alhambra, CA 91803."

It's in natural state: no road, no parking, no services, no illumination, no water or food. You drive from boqueron and pass the salt flats thought a dirt route (in good shape no need of 4x4) and you park in the side of road their is a limit of visitors and after mid morning the natural resorses vigilants prohibit car and visitors entrance. Bring a picking basket, enjoy the sugar like white sand, theirs not much to see snorkeling, for my the best part is the easy hicke to the light house and the acantilates views an photo opportunities, watch your step a few years ago a visitor fall to his death (see the memoria close to the lighthouse.

"Places You Must Go","Maldives","http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/worlds-best-honeymoon-destinations-for-2014#!4-maldives\n\nThe islands of the Maldives are quintessential honeymoon destinations with deserted beaches that vie for the title “most romantic spot in the world.” This archipelago of dozens of atolls and more than 1,100 coral islands span 35,000 square feet of the Indian Ocean and is located about 500 miles southwest of Sri Lanka. The Maldives are truly one of the last unspoiled island getaways in the world. \n\nIt’s hard to get there—get ready for a long-haul flight from the United States plus either a seaplane or boat transfer from the international airport—but the effort is rewarded with picture-perfect sunsets, wide beaches, and some of the best diving and snorkeling in the world. This is the place to interact with whale sharks, manta rays, reef sharks, sea turtles, and an array of colorful fish and sea creatures. Resorts are confined to their own islands so you won’t flit from place to place after you arrive. Almost all of the resorts are firmly in the “luxury” category. This is the place to book a beach villa or overwater bungalow.\n\nWhere to Stay: Every island resort is unique so you are bound to find one that fits your vacation style. Consider Per Aquum’s Huvafen Fushi with its underwater spa on the North Male Atoll or Niyama on Dhaalu Atoll. Other popular resorts include Taj Exotica Maldives known for the best cuisine in the South Male Atoll, Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru (North Male Atoll), and Angsana Valavaru (Dhaalu Atoll).\n\nPerfect for Couples Who: Love deserted island escapes. Spend your time lazing on the beach, swimming, snorkeling, diving, and enjoying Maldivian sunrises and sunsets.\n\nPhoto from Guardian article on the Maldives: http://goo.gl/jM4XQK"

"Places To Visit ","Basement Sate 8 Broadwick Street, London, W1F 8HN, sweet dessert and cocktails in Soho","\nPolitics and dinner parties, the colours yellow and purple, Katie Price and husbands – some things, however hard we try to make them, just don’t work well together.\n\nBut some things just do.\n\nFor example, things like Basement Sate – a secret concept bar completely dedicated to delicious desserts and masterfully-mixed cocktails.\n\nHidden away in the heart of Soho behind an unassuming and unmarked orange door, this sweet little joint pairs gorgeous puddings with innovative tipples to showcase a completely unique drinking experience in London. Hosted from their Mad Men-esque subterranean hideaway, those 'in the know' head here for mid-week drinks and DJ-fuelled parties till late come the weekend. Alongside the delectable treats on offer, you'll also find plush interiors, exposed brickwork and arguably most importantly, some damn sexy chairs. \n\nCurating a menu of such fanciful sweets and experimental libations is no beginner’s game. So far from it in fact, that Basement Sate have not only enlisted the help of Dorian Picard of Gordon Ramsay’s Maze fame to sort the desserts, but also Byly Tran, who is best known for his mixologist prowess at the infamous Prescription Cocktail Club, to take charge of the bar's b-e-a-utiful cocktail menu.\n\nIpso facto: this is the good sh*t.\n\nBut what’s life without a little offer? We’ve wrangled an exclusive deal for DesignMyNight users, which will entitle you to a free dessert of your choice to share when you buy your first two cocktails. \n\nBasement Sate is located at 8 Broadwick Street, London, W1F 8HN. The dessert offer is only redeemable after your first round, and only to those who book for free via DesignMyNight."

"Places to Go","Brecon Beacons Waterfalls","Lower Ddwli Falls, Waterfall Woods, Brecon Beacons\nIn the south-west hills of the Brecon Beacons, near Ystradfellte, you'll find some of the most amazing waterfall plunge pools in Britain. There are more than 20 pools along five miles of the Fechan and Mellte rivers, so you could try dipping in every one of them on a long day's walk. Lower Ddwli Falls is my favourite, a huge open pool with a great arc of a waterfall. Spray lifts up through the leaves and on a sunny day there are rainbows everywhere. Just downstream is Horseshoe Falls, with a great jump and rope swing. To reach them walk up the forest path from Pontneddfechan's Angel Inn or park at Pont Melinfach car park, off the Ystradfellte road, and walk downstream. If you want to make a weekend of it stay at Clyngwyn Bunkhouse.\nGrid reference: 51.7771, -3.5876"

"Places to Travel","Croatia","http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/worlds-best-honeymoon-destinations-for-2014#!11-croatia\n\nIf you love the Mediterranean but are tired of the crowds, it’s time to visit Croatia. While it’s gaining in popularity, peak vacation periods are not nearly as frenetic as their neighbors across the Adriatic. One of the best ways to explore the Dalmatian Coast is via cruise ship. You’ll call upon places like the city of Dubrovnik, which has been a bustling seaport since the 7th century; the island of Korcula, where you can bike, snorkel, or kayak; Split with the breathtaking Diocletian’s Palace—now a UNESCO World Heritage site—that was built in 305 AD; the fishing port of Rovinj; and the quaint island of Hvar with its beaches, lavender fields, groves of olive trees, pine forests, fruit orchards, and vineyards.\n\nWhere to Stay: There is no better way to get acquainted with Croatia than via cruise ship. Try the 694-passenger Azamara Quest, which sails a 7-night round-trip itinerary from Venice that calls upon Zadar, Split, Hvar, and Dubrovnik in Croatia plus Montenegro’s Kotor. Tere Moana, the intimate 90-guest ship from Paul Gauguin Cruises also sails round-trip from Venice with calls on Sibenik, Trogir, Split, Korcula, Dubrovnik, Hvar, and Rovinj. SeaDream Yacht Club’s 112-guest SeaDream II comes to the table with a Dubrovnik to Venice 7-night cruise that calls on Korcula, Hvar, Sibenik, Rab, Pula, and Piran.\n\nPerfect for Couples Who: Want a mix of Old Europe and a traditional Mediterranean cruise that offers plenty of beach time."

"Places to eat/do in Los Angeles","Dim sum restaurants in LA","3. Elite\nGo for the egg custard tart at Elite. It meets the criteria for a perfect egg tart: the crust is flaky and the inside, a sweet egg-based custard, is perfectly creamy. The shu mai, a sort of cylindrical dumpling stuffed with pork, is generously topped with a scallop. You order via menu at Elite. No carts here. 700 S. Atlantic Blvd., Monterey Park; 626-282-9998.\n\n2. Sea Harbour\nSea Harbour's arrival in Rosemead in 2002 really shepherded in a wave of high quality gourmet Chinese dining. It was one of the first places to have menu-driven dim sum, following a trend that began previously in Vancouver. While the outdoor facade is run-down, the dining experience inside Sea Harbour has changed very little from when they first opened. Our recommendations: the sticky rice ball with salty egg, the fish roe with scallop dumpling, and the baked BBQ pork bun. 3939 Rosemead Blvd., Rosemead, CA; 626-288-3939.\n\n1. Lunasia \nLunasia consistently remains my top pick because of the combination of atmosphere, quality, and portion size. It's a gorgeous venue and the dim sum bites are enormous. A typical crystal shrimp dumpling (known as har gow) has three or four pieces of shrimp crammed into its translucent wrapper. Don't forget to finish off with dessert. Lunasia has an almond milk soup served with egg white and topped with a flaky puff pastry. 500 W Main St, Alhambra, CA 91801; 626-308-3222. "

"Places to Visit","Лучшие велосипедные маршруты Киева. Велосипедистам на земетку","Для новичков идеально подойдет Парк Дружбы Народов. (фото 1) Там хоть и грунтовая в основном дорога, но довольно легкая – если не очень спешить. Нет подъемов, но попадаются колеи, из-за которых можно упасть, так что осторожнее.\nЕще один отличный для «покатушек» парк – Партизанской славы. (фото 2). Езжайте по Тропе здоровья, которая начинается в конце ул. Тростянецкой, после пересечения трамвайных путей. Живописная местность, хорошо утрамбованная грунтовка и спортивные площадочки по дороге.\nМожно поехать и дальше: пересечь дорогу, ведущую на м. Красный хутор и ехать далее не сворачивая, к лесным тропинкам с невероятными ланшафтами, но там уже сложнее. Если хватит сил, можно доехать до с. Княжичи.\nТем, кого интересует романтика «пересеченки» - добро пожаловать в Пущу. (фото 3) Можно, например, прокататься по грунтовой трассе Архимеда. Это уже, правда, для более опытных.\nИли по Краснофлотской, немного ближе к цивилизации. (фото 4)\nЧто касается асфальтированной местности, то здесь у велосипедистов куча проблем: по тротуару можно ездить только маленьким детям, а соседство с автомобилями не всегда безопасно. Власти давно уже обещают построить велодорожки, но пока что дело движется очень медленно. Впрочем, даже в такой ситуации велосипед отлично подходит для быстрых и безпробочных поездок на работу – но тут уж сами подбирайте маршрут. Главное только не отпугнуть коллег запахом благородного спортивного пота. Идеально, если на работе есть душ; если нету – умывальник и полотенце сгодятся. По последним подсчетам, велосипед для поездки на работу выбрали более 2 000 киевлян.\nВсего же в Киеве насчитывается приблизительно 15 тысяч велосипедистов. Те, кто увлекается этим всерьез, объединяются в велоклубы и устраивают эпичные коллективные «покатушки» - чаще всего за город. В черте города, впрочем, тоже хватит места для небольшого, но эпичного путешествия. Вот, например, приблизительный маршрут для круга по Левому берегу: (фото 5)"

Львівський купець родом з Угорщини Георгій Боїм розбагатів на торгівлі вином та отримавши громадянство Львова разом з посадою бургомістра вирішив збудувати родинну каплицю небаченої краси. Будівлю звели за проектом вроцлавського будівничого Андрія Бемера і освятили 1615 року.\n\nНа іншому фасаді від боку вулиці Галицької під склом старовинні оригінальні портрети Боїма і його дружини. Третій фасад має чудовий рельєф, що зображає Георгія Змієборця.\n\nКупол каплиці завершує статуя скорбного Христа у Гетсиманському саду, де він просить Отця, щоб Його оминули страждання на хресті. Сюжет, досить часто репрезентований у малярстві, у скульптурі є справді унікальним. Фасадна стіна каплиці вкрита суцільним кам’яним різьбленням на тему Страстей і фігурами святих Петра і Павла. Інтер’єр будівлі є не менш пишно декорований. При створенні багатофігурних композицій за звичаєм того часу використовували як моделей звичайних людей. Таким чином ми маємо тут нагоду побачити обличчя справжніх людей давньої епохи.\n\nКаплиця Боїмів славна цікавою енергетикою: працівниця музею розповідала, що якось забула у закутку каплиці кошик з яблуками; більше аніж через півтора року вона несподівано на нього наштовхнулася і виявила, що яблука за цей час абсолютно не втратили своєї соковитості та аромату.\n\nКаплиця Боїмів відкрита для відвідувачів лише в літні місяці."

Персонал собственноручно делает «домашнюю» колу, лимонад, оранжад и тоник из аутентичных американских сиропов по секретной рецептуре. Только здесь можно попробовать уникальный табачный биттер, кофе или виски, которые радикально поменяют ваше представление об этих напитках.\n\nИнтерьер кафе выполнен в желто-белой гамме, а элементы декора перекликаются с «яичной» тематикой заведения. Блинчики, сырники и оладьи подают с традиционными американскими топпингами – кленовым сиропом, джемом и арахисовым маслом.\n\nВ «Желтке» собраны все трендовые и фановые фишки американской культуры, сюжеты из голливудских фильмов и мультипликаций.\n\nДнём в Желтке можно сытно перекусить тридиционными американскими блюдами, которые по формату и цене близки к фаст-фуду, но с ресторанным качеством, а вечером – посидеть в романтической ресторанной атмосфере. Цены в «Желтке», как для ресторана, очень демократичные. Средний чек: 150 – 200 грн.\n\nВ 19:00 «Желток» трансформируется в ресторан. Вечернее меню состоит из холодных и горячих закусок, а также основных горячих блюд и гарниров. При этом супы, салаты, снеки и десерты здесь готовят на протяжении всего дня."

"Places to try","Les six meilleurs bars éphémères à Paris cet été","Les six meilleurs bars éphémères à Paris cet été\nPosté le 15 juillet 2015 dans Lieux, Lifestyle, Non classé, par Charlotte Hervot Tags: bars, Lieux, lifestyle, paris\n\nMagasins, restaurants, galerie ou même skate-park éphémères… la tendance pop-up se pérennise à Paris. Et les bars n’y échappent pas. Sélection.\n\n1/ La Javelle, l’esprit guinguette\n\n© La Javelle\nOù : On vous dit « terrasse sur les quais » et vous pensez VIIe, XIIIe et XIXe ? Poussez jusqu’à La Javelle dans le XVe, juste à côté du parc André-Citroën, dans le Port Javel-Bas.\n\nAmbiance : Passée la portion bétonnée et jalonnée par des entrepôts BTP, le quai de Javel invite à la promenade. Depuis l’an dernier, on s’arrête volontiers un peu avant le Pont du Garigliano, où la place en bitume se transforme quotidiennement en guinguette conviviale. Piste de danse, buvette joyeuse, food-trucks (Hank, Thaï la route, The Sunken Chip, Breizh Truck…) midi et soir, on ne pensait pas voir autant de vie de ce côté-ci de Paris.\n\nOn y va pour : Danser sous les lampions ; boire du rosé attablé à un tonneau ; goûter « l’ice cream roll », une crème glacée en rouleau tout droit venue d’Asie.\n\nLes plus : La possibilité de privatiser la péniche ; un menu différent chaque jour annoncé la veille sur Facebook.\n\nLes moins : Plus de réservation.\n\nLa Javelle, Port de Javel Bas, 75 015 Paris. Du 13 mai jusqu’à mi-septembre 2015. Tous les jours de midi à minuit (sauf météo défavorable).\n\n2/ Little Havana Paris, le plus exotique\n\n© Charlotte Hervot\nOù : Pour sa dernière opération marketing, la marque de rhum Havana Club a investi plusieurs bars du quartier du Canal Saint-Martin. Dont la terrasse du Café A, dans l’ancien Couvent des Récollets.\n\nAmbiance : Vous évitez les bars trop près des gares ? Dommage. Parce qu’à deux pas de la Gare de l’Est, le Café A offre une terrasse à l’abri du bruit et de la chaleur ambiante. Derrière les hauts murs en pierre, un décor typique de La Havane : façades en trompe-l’oeil aux couleurs des rues de Cuba, bar abrité dans des cabanons en tôle, tables et chaises dispersées dans le gravier blanc. A la carte de cette guinguette cubaine, on opte pour un mojito avec du rhum trois ans d’âge (9 €) avec une assiette de légumes croquants servis avec du raïta (10 €).\n\nEntendu : « Je vais pouvoir cradosser mes Stan Smith, c’est parfait. »\n\nOn y va pour : Apprendre à faire un mojito ; planter sa menthe et ses citrons verts… puis revenir les chercher plus tard ; boire un cocktail sur un transat au soleil au son des cloches de l’église Saint-Laurent.\n\nLes plus : Le jardin entretenu ; se croire à La Havane alors qu’on est à 200 mètres de la Gare de l’Est.\n\nLes moins : Le serveur qui vous empresse de payer avant d’avoir bu la première gorgée ; le démontage de la terrasse prévu fin juillet.\n\nCafé A, 148, rue du Faubourg Saint-Martin, 75 010 Paris. Du 17 juin au 31 juillet 2015. Du dimanche au samedi, 9 h-minuit.\n\n3/ La Vie est belle, la cantine au bord de l’eau\n\n© La Vie est belle\nOù ? Du Wanderlust à la BNF, le quai d’Austerlitz concentre une douzaine de terrasses. Sans compter les péniches amarrées. Et c’est face au bateau El Alamein que vous trouverez cette terrasse d'été.\n\nAmbiance : On s’y presse pour déjeuner sur le pouce, une énorme salade servie à la façon de Chez Gladines (entre 11 € et 14 € le saladier) ou un plat à emporter (5 € le hot dog, 6,5 € les quesadillas, 12 € le fish & chips). Si les tabourets hauts n’invitent pas à s’éterniser, les chiliennes en toile blanche sont parfaites pour se détendre, loin de la musique tonitruante des autres buvettes éphémères sur le quai. Deux dimanches par mois, la terrasse prend des allures de Cancale avec la Fête des Huîtres.\n\nOn y va pour : Se faire un baby-foot ; boire un verre dans un transat en bord de Seine ; le DJ set de la semaine.\n\nLes plus : Le service agréable et efficace ; la possibilité de réserver ; le plateau vegan.\n\nLes moins : Les toilettes de chantier ; les glaces qu'on pourrait aussi bien acheter en supermarché.\n\nLa Vie est belle, 10 quai François-Mauriac, 75 013 Paris. Jusqu’au 30 septembre 2015. Tous les jours de 11 h à 2 h (restaurant 12 h – 23 h).\n\n4/ Ground Control, le plus berlinois\n\n© Charlotte Hervot\nOù : L’été dernier, il avait pris ses quartiers sous la Cité de la mode et du design, quai d’Austerlitz, dans le XIIIe. Un an plus tard, le bar éphémère change de rive et rouvre dans un ancien dépôt SNCF de 2 000 m², près de la station Marcadet-Poissonniers.\n\nAmbiance : Mieux vaut s'y rendre avant 20 h pour éviter la queue. Pour boire un coup, il faut patienter, parfois longtemps, à l’une des trois buvettes. Verre consigné en main, vous avez le choix : vous poser au milieu des rails, danser dans la cour, refaire la queue à la trattoria ou assister à un concert dans un entrepôt bétonné. Spot underground comme à Berlin ? Oui, mais en plus cher (4 € le demi, 7 € la pinte). Et en moins nocturne, puisque le Ground Control ferme à minuit, voisins oblige.\n\nEntendu : « Comment ça il y a un poulaille... \nhttp://style.lesinrocks.com/2015/07/15/les-six-meilleurs-bars-ephemeres-a-paris-cet-ete/"

The popular pizzeria is a shift away from Detroit-style deep dish (which we love!) to a Neapolitan-style, utilizing locally sourced produce and proteins (which we also love!). It was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, and made Mancini a late-'00s Detroit Restaurateur Hall of Famer, among the cohort that kick-started Detroit's current restaurant renaissance (including Slows). Mancini's La Rondinella, which will open in the space adjoining Supino, is one of the most anticipated restaurant openings in recent years. OPEN OPEN OPEN OPEN."

It’s pricier, but I’ve eaten a few of my favorite meals ever here. One of the best-kept “secrets” at the beach. Upscale dining, cool vibe and yet relaxed.  Make a reservation if dining in for dinner.\n\n \nIll Giardino Ristorante on 910 Atlantic Ave, Virginia Beach, VA 23451 is another favorite place.\n\nFor more relaxed dining Waterman’s Surfside Grille or Home Republic on 31st — amazing burgers!"

"Places to travel (Lviv, ua)","!!!!!Итальянский Дворик = Палац Корнякта","Палац Корнякта – надзвичайно цінна ренесансна пам’ятка 1580 року, палац найбагатшого львів’янина за всю історію міста купця Костянтина Корнякта.\n\nГрек за походженням, з острова Крит, Костянтин Корнякт, котрий замешкав у Львові в XVI столітті і контролював торгівлю вином на всьому Чорномор’ї, був меценатом, досвідченим і мудрим чоловіком, знав багато східних мов. Завдяки Корнякту ми тепер насолоджуємось чудовими архітектурними пам’ятками Львова епохи Ренесансу. Цю кам’яницю збудував для нього на місці колишніх двох італійський архітектор Петро Барбон. За тодішніми законами усі кам’яниці, розташовані на Площі Ринок, могли мати не більше трьох вікон по фасаду, це було так зване правило рівних можливостей, адже кожне вікно першого поверху могло використовуватись для облаштування майстерні, крамниці чи аптеки, а також для реклами. Навіть найбагатший громадянин Львова Костянтин Корнякт, будучи купцем, не міг порушити цього правила. І лише пізніше, за свої заслуги перед польськими королями, одержав дворянський титул і дозвіл збудувати собі палац зі шістьма вікнами. \nУ середині XVII століття палац Корнякта перейшов до родини польського короля Яна ІІІ Собеського і відтоді почав називатися Королівською кам’яницею. 1908 року будівлю викупило місто, і вже майже сто років тут працює Львівський історичний музей.  \nУ будівлі після ренесансної перебудови збереглася Готична зала – єдина українська пам’ятка світської готики XV століття, тут також працює антикварний магазин. Надзвичайною атракцією палацу Корнякта є італійське подвір’я, напрочуд схоже з типовими двориками Флоренції і Риму. Тут, серед цієї європейської краси, неможливо залишатися байдужим. У цьому подвір’ї у теплу пору року працює кафе, відбуваються традиційні концерти, фестивалі класичної і джазової музики, унікальна акустика також створює незабутнє враження. У подвір’ї можна оглянути пранґер – ганебний стовп, біля якого у середньовіччі виконували покарання над злочинцями.  \nКостянтин Корнякт, будучи вже польським дворянином, все ж не міг полишити своєї улюбленої справи – торгівлі вином. Над входом його будинку висіла гілка ялини – знак, що тут шинкують вином.  У просторих  пивницях кам`яниці зберігали вино, яке нагору подавали ліфтом. Зал освітлювався олійними світильниками, тож тут й досі збереглися забиті у стелю кільця, на яких вони висіли. Що цікаво, але пускали до винарні лише громадян Львова із товстими гаманцями. Проте сьогодні всі охочі можуть відвідати стару винарню у підвальному приміщенні, де витає атмосфера минулих віків.\nУ приміщенні палацу працює відділення Львівського історичного музей - Відділ історичних коштовностей. Де можна можна оглянути унікальні, збережені в первинному вигляді, інтер'єри, та багато цікавих історичних експонатів."

"Places to Travel","Belize","http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/worlds-best-honeymoon-destinations-for-2014#!7-belize\n\nLocated in Central America, Belize is an incredibly compelling honeymoon destination for three simple reasons: its close proximity to the United States (a two-hour flight from Miami), its weather (around 84 degrees daily year-round), and the 190-mile-long Belize Barrier Reef. The reef is easily accessible along the coast and is wildly popular for snorkeling and scuba trips, fishing excursions, and romantic sunset cruises. \n\nThe country is hemmed in by the Caribbean Sea on the east, Guatemala to the west, and Mexico in the north. In addition to the Belize Barrier Reef, the country is gifted with pristine beaches, jungle and rainforests, and ruins dating back to the Mayan period. Belize attracts a variety of honeymooners, from nature-lovers to history buffs to diving fanatics to those who simply prefer to sit on the beach at their resort with drink in hand.\n\nWhere to Stay: If water adventures aren’t your thing but you’d still love to honeymoon in Belize, head to Ka’ana Resort in the western part of the country. This inland boutique resort is located in a valley in the Maya Mountains in the Cayo District. Luxurious 1,250-square-foot, one-bedroom private pool villas offer the best of indoor/outdoor living and are ideal for romantic getaways. From the resort, you can enjoy day trips to the Tapir Mountain Nature Reserve; Maya ruins like Tikal, Zunantunichm, and Caracol; Barton Creek Cave for kayaking; horseback riding along the bank of the Mopan River; or go jaguar tracking or bird-watching with expert naturalists and guides.\n\nPerfect for Couples Who: Want an authentic and luxurious but eco-friendly experience that blends the country’s culture with outdoor activities like zip-lining and cave tubing."

"Places to book a gig","Boston -","Hip spots usually don't pay much!... but let's see, it depends if you want a booking at a club or want to do an underground show. You know how it is better than me. I don't go to many hip spots myself. The hippest thing I went to recently was an improvisation party thrown by Chris Baum (electric violinist & composer, lived in the loft at Wyman after we left)- it was at a studio called The Space on Brookside Ave. As far as clubs go, Church is pretty hip I think. Brighton Music Hall is pretty big. There's a music series at the Loring Greenough House in JP. Ask Chris where to play-- he'd have a pretty good idea I think.\nChris Baum <chrispbaum@gmail.com>\n\nWhat kind of venue are you looking for? The Lilypad, The Lizard Lounge, and The Beat Hotel are decent spots in Cambridge. Club Church, Great Scott, and The Red Room at Cafe 939 are worth checking into in greater Boston.\n\n. You're best bet is probably The Beat Hotel or The Lizard Lounge. I'd give Club Passim a try as well.\n\nYou might also consider contacting Ken at The Space (https://www.facebook.com/brooksidespace?fref=ts), a new-ish DIY warehouse venue in JP that I've hosted a number of events at. There's no guarantee, but door proceeds are generally split down the middle, and the venue generally attracts a music-loving, merch-buying crowd."

"Places to visit Hong Kong","Sai Kung","ISLAND-HOPPING IN SAI KUNG\n\nExploring the islands that encircle the peninsula is a delightful way to see Sai Kung. Most kaido (small, open-sea ferries) leave from the piers on the waterfront, just in front of Hoi Pong Sq.\n\nThe first island to the east of Sai Kung Town is Yeung Chau (Sheep Island). You’ll be able to spot a horseshoe-shaped burial plot up on the slope; it’s so designed for reasons dictated by feng shui. Southeast of Yeung Chau, Pak Sha Chau (White Sand Island) has a popular beach on its northern shore.\n\nJust beyond Pak Sha Chau is the northern tip of the much larger Kiu Tsui Chau (Sharp Island), arguably the most popular island destination. Kiu Tsui Chau has several fine beaches: Kiu Tsui and, connected to it by a sand spit, Kiu Tau on the western shore; and Hap Mun on the island’s southern tip. Both can be reached by kaido (HK$40) directly from Sai Kung Town.\n\nThe charming island of Yim Tin Tsai is accessible by ‘scheduled’ kaido (return HK$35, 15 minutes, departs hourly 10am to 3pm Saturday and Sunday). Literally ‘Little Salt Field’, the island is so-called because the original fisherfolk who lived here augmented their income by salt-panning. A few minutes’ walk from the jetty up a small flight of steps to the left is St Joseph’s Chapel, the focal point of the island. The villagers, who all belong to the same clan, converted to Catholicism 150 years ago after St Peter appeared on the island to chase away pirates who had been harassing them. There’s also a modest cafe open daily.\n\nYim Tin Tsai is connected to the much larger island of Kau Sai Chau by a narrow spit of land that becomes submerged at high tide. Kau Sai Chau is the site of the 36-hole Jockey Club Kau Sai Chau Public Golf Course ( GOOGLE MAP ; ￼%2791 3388; www.kscgolf.org.hk/index-e.asp; Kau Sai Chau, Sai Kung), a public links course that can be reached by the course’s direct ferry from Sai Kung (adult/concession HK$60/35 return, departs every 20 minutes daily from 6.40am to 7pm). Boats dock in Sai Kung Town at the long pier opposite the new Sai Kung Waterfront Park. The 19th-century Hung Shing Temple at the southern tip of Kau Sai Chau won a Unesco restoration award in 2000.\n\nBeyond Kau Sai Chau is Leung Shuen Wan (糧船灣; High Island), a long trip from Sai Kung Town, and the High Island Reservoir (萬宜水庫), which is now part of the Hong Kong Geopark. This largest reservoir of Hong Kong was built in 1978 by damming what was once a large bay with dolooses (huge cement barriers shaped like jacks); sea water was then siphoned out and fresh water pumped in. To the west of the dam is the newly opened Astropark (天文公園 ￼%2792 6810; http://astropark.hk.space.museum; ￼h24hr), located in a water-sports centre, where you can stargaze from the naked-eye observation area. The park also has a replica of a 17th-century Chinese celestial globe and a campground. Reservations a must.\n\nIf you want to be out on the water for a longer period or have greater flexibility as to where you go, you can hire your own boat. Kaido owners can usually be found trawling for fares. Explain where you want to go, how long you want to spend there and which way you wish to return. The usual price for this kind of trip is about HK$300 on weekdays, more on the weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nChuen Kee Seafood RestaurantCANTONESE, SEAFOOD\n\n(全記海鮮菜館 MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ￼%2792 6938; 87-89 Man Nin St; meals from HK$180; ￼h7am-11pm; ￼g1)\n\nChuen Kee has two locations in Sai Kung. This is the plush branch of the flagship on the promenade. The elaborate display of fish and crustaceans at the door may make you cringe, but cringe will turn to crave once you’ve had a bite of the cooked versions.\n"

"Places to visit Hong Kong","Cheung Chau and Lamma","Ferry Ferries (2375 7883; www.ferry.com.hk) run from Yung Shue Wan Pier to pier 4 of Central’s Outlying Islands ferry terminal, Pak Kok Tsuen (Lamma) and Aberdeen; they also go from Sok Kwu Wan pier to Pier 4 of Central’s Outlying Islands ferry terminal, Mo Tat Wan (Lamma) and Aberdeen.\n\nPRACTICAL TIP\n\nCENTRAL TO OUTLYING ISLANDS FERRY SERVICES\n\nThere are two types of ferries: the large ‘ordinary ferries’ that, with the exception of those to Lamma, offer ordinary and deluxe classes; and the smaller ‘fast ferries’ that cut travel time by between 10 and 20 minutes, but cost between 50% and 100% more.\n\nPrices are higher on Sunday and public holidays. Unless stated otherwise, children aged three to 11 years, seniors over 65 years and people with disabilities pay half-fare on both types of ferries and in both classes. Return is double the single fare.\n\nTickets are available from booths at the ferry piers, but avoid queuing at busy times by using an Octopus card or putting the exact change into the turnstile as you enter.\n\nFerry timetables are prominently displayed at all ferry piers, or you can read them on the ferry companies’ websites.\n\nListed below are some of the more popular routes:\n\nCentral (Pier 6)–Mui Wo on Lantau Island Adult ordinary/deluxe class/fast ferry HK$15.20/25.40/29.90 (HK$22.50/37.20/42.90 on Sunday and public holidays); 50 to 55 minutes with large ferry and 31 minutes with fast ferry; departures around every half-hour from 6.10am (from 7am Sunday and public holidays). The last ferry from Mui Wo to Central departs at 11.30pm.\n\nCentral (Pier 4)–Yung Shue Wan on Lamma Island Adult HK$16.10 (HK$22.30 on Sunday and public holidays); 30 to 35 minutes; departures approximately every half-hour to an hour. The last boat to Central from Yung Shue Wan departs at 11.30pm.\n\nCentral (Pier 4)–Sok Kwu Wan on Lamma Island Adult HK$19.80 (HK$28 on Sunday and public holidays); 40 minutes; departures every 1½ hours or so from 7.20am to 11.30pm. The last ferry to Central from Sok Kwu Wan is at 10.40pm.\n\nCentral (Pier 5)–Cheung Chau (ordinary ferry) Adult ordinary/deluxe class/fast ferry HK$12.60/19.70/24.60 (HK$18.40/28.70/35.30 on Sunday and public holidays); 55 to 60 minutes with large ferry and 35 minutes with fast ferry; departures approximately every half-hour from 6.10am. The last boat to Central from Cheung Chau departs at 11.45pm.\n\nLamma\n\nExplore\n\nLamma, Hong Kong's laid-back 'hippie island', is easily recognisable at a distance by the three coal chimneys crowning its hilly skyline. The chimneys stand out so much because Lamma, home to 6000 or so, is otherwise devoid of high-rise development. Here it's all about lush forests, hidden beaches and chilled-out villages connected by pedestrian paths. You won't see any cars here, but be prepared for spotting the odd snake.\n\nMost visitors arrive in the main town of Yung Shue Wan, a counterculture haven popular with expats. From here, the most interesting way to see a good portion of the island is to amble along the 4km-long Family Trail that runs between Yung Shue Wan and Sok Kwu Wan, the island's second town (really little more than a strip of seafood restaurants). Those happy to be out in the hot sun should carry on to Tung O Wan, an idyllic bay some 30 minutes further south, and perhaps return to Sok Kwu Wan via Mo Tat Wan.\n\nPENG CHAU\n\nBackwater Peng Chau does not possess much wow factor but it is perhaps the most traditionally Chinese of the Outlying Islands, with narrow alleyways, crowded housing, a covered wet market (坪洲街市) near the ferry pier, a couple of small but important temples, and interesting shops selling everything from humble household goods to religious paraphernalia. Come any day and you can count on the clatter of mah-jong tiles and Cantonese opera tunes leaking from old transistors to act as a soundtrack to this sleepy getaway.\n\nFerry services from Central leave from pier 6 of the Outlying Islands ferry terminal. Ferries also depart from Mui Wo and Chi Ma Wan on Lantau and from Cheung Chau. Additionally, regular kaido (small open-sea ferries) operate to Peng Chau from the Trappist Monastery and Discovery Bay on Lantau.\n\nThere are no cars on Peng Chau, and you can walk around it easily in an hour.\n.\n\n"

"Places to visit copy","Arras, France","If the town of Arras in northeastern France rings any bells, it’s most likely to be for its position near the thick of frontline action in WWI. However, with its vertiginous belfry and colourful arcaded squares, the town exuberantly defies the expectations of its sombre history. Its two ancient market squares, the Grand Place and nearby Petite Place, are surrounded by a confectionery of Flemish-Spanish houses, pastel-hued, gaily decorated creations erected in the 17th and 18th Centuries. Together, their 350 or so columns form an arcade that’s unique in France. Petite Place is also the site of another focal point – the ornate city hall, whose Unesco-listed belfry shoots up 75m above Arras’s streets and offers heady views. Beneath the square is another site worth a visit: the historic souterrains (tunnels) that became British command posts, hospitals and barracks in WWI and which, each spring, blossom into a uniquely life-affirming garden.

"Places to visit copy","Southeastern Anatolia, Turkey","A world away from cosmopolitan Istanbul or Turkey’s laid-back coastal resorts, little-visited Southeastern Anatolia deserves equal fame. Once the northern frontier of Mesopotamia (the ‘cradle of civilization’), the region encompasses an astonishing array of sites, reaching far back into human history. The recently excavated stone circles of Göbekli Tepe, for example, are thought to comprise the world’s oldest temple. Comparatively youthful at just a few millennia old are S ̧anlıurfa (‘the Prophet’s City’) – an ancient spiritual centre of mosques, shady courtyards and a labyrinthine bazaar – and the beehive houses of Harran. Equally captivating are Mardin, where golden stone houses look over sunbaked plains, and the colossal ancient statues that crowd a remote mountaintop at Nemrut Dag ̆ı. Several of these places are stops on the recently inaugurated Turkish section of Abraham’s Path, a 100-mile trail through sites linked to the prophet’s life, sleeping in homestays along the way.

We stayed with a lovely lady called Rebecca and her daughter Lucrecia. We ended up staying 2 nights and it was the best decision we made. The second day, we helped them herd sheep over the island with all the islanders and carry barley back. Great fun and a lovely experience, there weren't any other tourists there on day 2 until late afternoon so you really feel local. We then got a boat to Taquile and stayed there a night (all included in your round trip ticket from Puno). We didn't like Taquile half as much as Amantani. It was much more expensive and touristy. Be warned though, both islands are completely Baltic at night. We were frozen! Bring lots of layers :-)"

"Places to visit copy","Ikaria, Greece","If you’re after somewhere to eat, drink and unwind, look no further than Ikaria, a place so restorative that living to 100 years here is no big deal. No-one’s quite sure what accounts for residents’ exceptional longevity, but the sheer serenity of the place must have something to do with it (the hot springs probably help, too). A hilly isle in the northeast Aegean mostly bypassed by tourism, it’s strewn with crumbling ruins, secluded bays and tiny villages where residents gather to tell stories, play backgammon and drink. Vineyard-rich Ikaria’s a particularly fine place for this last pursuit, being the mythical birthplace of both Dionysus, god of wine, and of his favourite tipple. Enjoy its signature red over a plate of local produce in the cascading village of Karavostamo or in the easy-going port of Agios Kirykos. Summer is the best time to experience the joie de vivre of Greek island culture, when panigyria (all-night festivals) ring in saints’ days with feasting, drinking and dancing galore.(Chris Christo/Getty)"

"Places to Visit","Royal National Park, Australia","hiking/kayaking/camping at the Royal National Park. We'll be camping right next to the river/bay with access to kayak trips and freakin' amazing hikes--It's like hiking from Coogee to Bondi but much much better with options to do 2, 4, or 7 hour hikes. \n \nThe Royal National Park can be reached in 1 hour via public transport so you don't need a car and it's easy to get down there on Friday after work. \n \nThis is a joint event between Sydney Expat Americans and the international Bootcamp group. \n \nTRIP COST \n$115 which includes camping, kayaking, and a meal+drink at the local café (i.e. burger)—spots on the trip are limited and available on a first to pay basis--payments must be made by Wednesday Feb 12th at the drinks/info session. \n \nKAYAKING Details: At the pre-trip event we will discuss kayak options, and have a mix of open use sessions, and 2 hour guided trips into the national park. \n \nBUSHWALKING: We will have several trail suggestions and groups going out together. \n \nWe've booked out every camp site available and a fleet of kayaks for the entire weekend and we don't want to be chasing people down for money at the last minute so payments must be made by Wednesday Feb 12th, but if there are any spots still available, there may be a chance to join the trip at a higher price. As per campsite policies, refunds are only available until Friday Feb 7th and then afterwards, no refunds or swapping out for another person. \n \nDON'T HAVE CAMPING GEAR? \nIt's super cheap at Kmart. You can get everything you need $25. \n \nDON'T KNOW ANYONE YET? \nThere are a bunch of new people and we're going to have pre-drinks on Wednesday Feb 12th at Cheers Bar so you'll meet lots of people there or at the campground. \nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/361510687322790/361532327320626/ \n \nDON'T HAVE TRANSPORTATION? \nYou can get there in 90 minutes on the public train/ferry. \n \nFOOD \nOne meal+drink is included and there's an IGA with a bottle shop 1km/15 minutes walk from the camp site near the Bundeena Ferry Wharf (you'll pass by it on your way in from the ferry). They are open until 8pm every day. If you want to team up with 3-4 people to do group food ask around at the Pre-Drinks. \n \nNO REFUNDS after Feb 7th \nThere are no refunds for bad weather or if you party too hard and get kicked out by the ranger or whatever else. If you party late or loud/stay as far away from the campsite as possible or bear the risk of other campers getting upset (although we’ve booked out have the campground for ourselves). \n \nThe price includes joining us on the trip, camping, one cafe meal voucher, and at least one two hour kayaking session. It doesn't include transportation, camping gear, other food, vehicle entry to the park, hand-holding to tell you exactly what to do every hour of the trip or anything else. There's lots of fun stuff to do in the area and we’ll have some suggested itineraries for hikes, kayaking, and other activities or you can follow what everyone else does, but it’s ultimately up to you to do what you want--we're just getting a bunch of fun people together for the trip. \n \nBryon has pre-paid for the campsites, kayaks, eco fees, etc already, so send him a transfer to confirm your spot and email him when you make payment so he can confirm you as paid for the trip. \n \nPAYMENT DETAILS: \nBryon Merzeo \nBSB: 302973 \nAccount: 0283011 \nDescription: your name \n \nFAQ \nCamp sites have bathrooms/showers, but no electricity. You're responsible for reading the campsite website to understand all details. \n \nHikes \nThere are lots of great hikes you can do in the area and I can tell you a bit about them and you can probably join me and many others in the group to hike, but in the end you're responsible for your own hike. \nA) Hike from Bundeena to Watamalla and back \nB) Hike from Otford to Bundeena (27km) - take ferry from Bundeena to Crunulla and train from Crunulla to Otford then walk back to Bundeena (total trip time: 9.5 hours = 90 minutes traveling, 6.5 hours walking, 90 minute resting. \n \nTrip Highlights: \nWaters Edge Campsite with modern facilities, Beautiful bushwalks, relaxing beach time, guided kayak trips, billabong swimming hole, snorkelling, sand bar picnics, night walk through ‘Skeleton Mangroves’ and of course camping with 70 people will be crazy fun. \n \nThe Plan: \nFriday after work you jump on a train southbound to the end of the line in Cronulla. 3 minute walk brings you to the historic ferry across the harbour to Bundeena village. There is a BOTTLE SHOP and IGA FOOD STORE here, plus several cafes to eat up & stock up supplies. The campsite is 1km along the sidewalk—pop open a roadie drink on your way. After setting up your tent, come to the beach for sunset over the water and meet the others. \n \nThe campsite is great, with hot showers, running water, pretty good flush toilets, etc. \n \nAfter dark we’ll check out the sand flats, mangrove forest and look for bio-illuminescent plankton in the lagoon with a bevie in hand! \n \nSaturday- wake and have a morning swim if you want. Breakfast could be at the maianbar café or make your own. Then choose your own adventure from the many activities suggested below, or just relax on the beach and enjoy the national park. \n \nBonnie Vale beach, the sand bars, mangrove forests & billabong swimming hole are amazing and lot's of fun to explore and play on. Frisbee, Volleyball, snorkelling, long walks on the beach, etc. At low tide you can watch platoons of soldier crabs on the sand bar. Plus there is often Bioluminescent plankton on the beach and in the lagoon which we can swim with at night. My favourite bushwalk in the area is Bundeena to Marley Beach. you walk along the coastline and over beautiful sandstone rock formations to finish at a huge beach and sand dune. 12km and about 4 hour return. Link: http://www.wildwalks.com/bushwalking-and-hiking-in-nsw/royal-national-park/bundeena-to-marley-beach.html \n \nOptional activities planned – tentative schedule: \n10am-Kayak group trip 2 hours \n9am Brekky & Bushwalk- Maianbar cafe. Swim, sand bar exploring, beach walk. 2km return. \n9am Brekky & Bushwalks- Bundeena 3km return. \n> Bushwalks onward from Bundeena: \nCoastal Track to Marley Beach-beautiful trail. 12km return LINK \nJibbon Beach-swimming & rock carvings. 3km return \n12- Lunch excursion-Drive into National Park to Audley Café 30 minutes.

These are just 20 steps from the beach, and removed about 100 meters from the Campground entrance and other sites. Good quality toilets, with lights, running water, hot showers are located at the campground entrance for people to use. This area will serve well for late night drinking and the associated noise, given it is removed from other guests, plus a beautiful spot overlooking the bay, with plenty of sand beach and open area to enjoy. \nBreakfast: Maianbar Beach Café is a 15 minute walk from the campground, along a wide path through a mangrove forest, over the billabong lagoon, and down the road into the small village of Maianbar. This café is run by Nick and his wife, whom I have known for several years."

"Places to visit ","Nicaragua ","Hey there!  It was nice seeing you too! Alana James \nHere's the places I recommended:\n- San Juan Del Sur - it's a little surf town in Nicaragua; really cute; I don't remember where I stayed, but the hotels there are small and not luxury (but fine)\n- Morgan's Rock - this is a really nice boutique lodge on the coast in Nicaragua...  it's not too far from San Juan del Sur (maybe an hour?).  I've stayed there a few times and it's really beautiful; amazing beach\n- Granada - really cute old spanish-style town in Nicaragua; about an hour from Managua, and on the way to both San Juan del Sur and Morgan's Rock; definitely recommend spending a day or 2 there...  There are some nice boutique hotels there...  if you're thinking of going, I can look and see where I stayed because it was pretty awesome:)\n\nAlso, i would recommend renting a 4WD vehicle if you are going to do this trip.\n\nThis is making me want to go back!  Hope you guys have an awesome time and hope to see you soon.  Let me know if you have any more questions!! "

With glittering lakes, the country’s only bona fide forest and moody mist-ringed mountains, it’s no wonder 19th-century Romantics like poet William Wordsworth flocked here for inspiration. \nWhere to stay: Hidden at the end of a road is Lakefield Boathouse (from $1,700 for a 7-night stay, LakefieldBoathouse.com), a cozy B&B on Britain’s second-largest lake, complete with a private shoreline. Take the property’s rowboat out for a romantic afternoon paddle."

"Places to go in Vancouver","Bowen Island","Another big dog move for dinner would be to take the ferry to Bowen island. This would take some more effort but it'd be super romantic and if you screw up at some point during this trip it might be a good thing to keep in your back pocket. You'd have to drive across the lion's gate bridge to the horseshoe bay ferry terminal. Then you park and buy a ferry ticket which is like 12 bucks round trip per person I think. Hop on the ferry and enjoy incredible views for 20 minutes, really incredible views. If you're early for the ferry grab an ice cream cone and relax in the little park right next to the ferry terminal. When you get to the island hop off and eat at one of the restaurants right up the street, there are like three. An Italian one, something else, and another one. Apparently they are all good, I've only eaten at Miksa which was tasty. Just make sure you don't miss the last ferry back! The food is good but the views on the ferry are knock your socks off good. To do this you'd have to check the ferry schedule (it's really regular) and also talk to the concierge about traffic/time it takes to get to the horseshoe bay terminal. With no traffic you can get there from downtown in 25 minutes, with traffic it can easily be up to an hour."

The southwest TH start for this ""all-in-one"" trip begins at Mammoth, AZ(2450'), reaches a high point 15.25 miles in of 5385' at Table Mountain Saddle (the Galiuro Divide) and has its northeast TH end at Hwy 70/Klondyke-Aravaipa Canyon Road at 2824' (~6 miles west of Pima, AZ, and ~10mls west of Safford,AZ). History: During the late 1870's when gold, silver mining and ranching were beginning to be a prominent means of income for many Arizona settlers in this Galiuro Mountains area between Mammoth and the tiny town of Klondyke, there was a need to establish a through route. As the crow flies it was only about a 20 mile distance between Mammoth and Klondyke, but actual driving routes between these two settlements without a through route was over 150 miles utilizing the existing highways, county, and ranch roads through Globe or Wilcox. The Rug Road, so named from the multi-colored patches of old carpet remnants that were embedded into one bad hill climb segment of this road at Boulder Saddle known as ""Carpet Hill"". History and rumor have it that this segment of the Rug Road was there to service the old Salazar Ranch. Back in the 1950's, Mister Salazar drove a conventional two wheel drive pick-up and had trouble negotiating the climb up & down what is now known as ""Carpet Hill"" (a .70 mile rutted, loose-rocky, gnarly, hill drop/climb of over 650+ feet). Salazar supposedly drove into Tucson one day and collected as many carpet remnants as he could and then deposited them on this bad hill. The idea was to slow down road erosion and to help prevent ruts from developing during rain downpours. It was also used to aid in traction going up and downhill. This act has so named this legendary old Arizona through route for eternity..""The Rug Road"". Warnings: It has been said that ""any road that is difficult enough for carpets needed to aid in traction must be bad"". If you chose to drive this 70 mile through ""Rug Road"" route, it should be noted that if you are driving a short wheel base 4x4 vehicle as I was, for 17 miles of the total 70 mile trip, you will need, at a minimum: 32"" tires and one full locker in the rear differential (Note: On a short wheel base 4x4, for more security and for safety reasons, I recommend 33"" or larger tires, full lockers both front and back, and with aftermarket lower ring & pinion gearing). If you decide to drive this 70 mile through route from Mammoth to Hwy 70(west to east), it will easier to negotiate down ""Carpet Hill"" than traveling this same route from Hwy 70 to Mammoth(east to west) as it will be more difficult to climb up the ""Carpet Hill"" segment.. but by no means am I implying that this ""Carpet Hill"" segment is your only 4x4 driving challenge for this above mentioned 17 mile 4x4 section. Special Notice: The Aravaipa Road (BLM Route#5018) north of the Klondyke Store, which provides through driving access for this 70 mile trip and the only public access into the east end of Aravaipa Canyon Preserve, ""may"" be closed passing through private property. Public access into Aravaipa Canyon(#5018), Turkey Creek Canyon(#5018), and further into Oak Grove Canyon(BLM#5019), Parson's Grove/Canyon(#5019) via this Rug Road route ""may"" be affected. As of this writing, I had no problems with any closures - I had no private gate road closures to deal with. Before your planned drive through trip, it is recommended you call the responsible BLM office in Safford at 928-348-4400 and just reference this issue and as about associated status of BLM Routes #5018 and #5019. Not recommended, you can also ""risk it"" as I did: Once you are on your way into this 70 mile route from Mammoth, when you see another person on the route ask them if they know the road open status at the other end. If they came in from Hwy 70 or Klondyke and you are traveling in that direction from Mammoth, more than likely the roads will be open for your exit through.. but best to stop them and ask! Trip: I completed this 70 mile through trip in my modified short wheel base Jeep from Mammoth to Hwy 70 and camped for two nights 18 miles in at a lovely, shaded oak treed, primitive campsite (4503') at the Upper Virgus Canyon area, just off the Rug Road. As I previously mentioned, his Rug Road can and has been mountain biked by advanced level mountain bikers who generally prefer to start in at Mammoth and bike through the first long day to either Turkey Creek Canyon or to Klondyke to camp the night, then reverse route the next day back to Mammoth for Mexican Food. Also, the Rug Road can be planned as an extended backpack trip which would offer more time to enjoy the area with numerous primitive campsites to choose from, various seasonal & perennial springs & creeks with hopefully time to day hike some of the remote and rugged canyons and explore the numerous old ranch site history (cabins & corrals) that this Rug Road crosses (Sycamore Cyn, Upper Virgus Cyn, Parsons Cyn, Oak Grove Cyn, Turkey Creek Cyn, and if you have a permit- Aravaipa Canyon Preserve). I am posting with this hike description the official GPS Routes (2) for this 70 mile trip: The first GPS Route starts in at Mammoth and goes 18 miles in to my above referenced campsite (+2965' & AEG of +4651'), the second GPS Route starts from this campsite and goes the additional 52 miles ending at Hwy 70 (-1755' & AEG of +3813').\n\nRead more at: http://hikearizona.com/decoder.php?ZTN=2099\nCopyright © 2015 hikearizona.com"

"Places to Go","Guilin (China)","INTERNACIONAL\nAVE al paraíso\nChina apuesta por la red de trenes de alta velocidad para potenciar el crecimiento del turismo interior, como en Guilin\n\nELISENDA VALLEJO GUILIN. ENVIADA ESPECIAL\n\nUn calor asfixiante. Un paisaje de ensueño. Y de repente, la lluvia.\nLos turistas a bordo del crucero por el río Li aprovechan para descansar en el interior y repasar su obra fotográfica. El recorrido en barco de Guilin a Yangshuo es uno de los más bellos de China y todos han apurado al máximo sus cámaras, teléfonos, tabletas...\nPero no tienen “ la foto”.\nEn medio del chaparrón, el grueso del pasaje – turistas chinos, taiwaneses, coreanos ...– sale en tromba al exterior. “ Pero ¿ qué hacen ahí dentro ? Es la foto!”, avisa uno de los guías. Y sí, lo es.\nPorque ningún ciudadano chino a bordo quiere perderse el preciado souvenir, esa selfie con el billete de 20 yuans en las manos y, de fondo, el mismísimo encuadre del paisaje que reproduce el reverso (Mao sigue al otro lado, claro).\nLa provincia de Guilin, en la región de Guangxi, es uno de los destinos favoritos del turista chino, el cuarto por detrás de Pekín, Shanghai y Xian. Con una población de 1.300 millones de personas, el progreso de las últimas décadas ha convertido a China en el primer país emisor de turismo del mundo (107 millones viajaron fuera de la China continental en el 2014) y ha disparado el turismo interior, que aporta ya un 4 % al crecimiento del PIB del país.\nEl rápido crecimiento de las infraestructuras por todo el país ha contribuido a esa expansión del turismo. Nuevos aeropuertos, carreteras, ferries y, por supuesto, la amplia red de trenes de alta velocidad, están poniendo las cosas más fáciles a una clase media que también se desarrolla con rapidez. “ Tenemos 11.725 kilómetros de AVE construidos y otros 12.000 más en construcción ”, explica Zhang Zhiyun, director de la Oficina Nacional de Turismo de China en España. En Guilin al frente de una delegación española presente en la feria de turismo de esa ciudad, Zhang subraya la importancia de esa expansión de la red del AVE para el crecimiento del turismo y ofrece un dato que pone en perspectiva el esfuerzo inversor de Pekín en esta infraestructura: en el resto del mundo hay sólo 11.600 kilómetros de trenes de alta velocidad construidos y 4.800 en construcción.\nEl AVE llega a Guilin, y también a Yangshuo, surcando un paisaje inverosímil. Una extensión de pequeñas colinas recubiertas de vegetación, formaciones kársticas surgidas del mar que han tomado a menudo formas sorprendentes, como pensadas para espolear la imaginación humana. Aquí un caballo, allá un dragón, la corona de un rey ... La bruma entre las montañas da el toque final a un paraje bellísimo. Y con indudable gancho para el turismo.\nPero ¿ podrá resistir intacto la presión del turismo ? Yangshuo, una ciudad de 300.000 habitantes, pequeña para los estándares chinos, se encuentra 60 kilómetros al sur de Guilin, en una zona de clima subtropical próxima a la frontera con Vietnam. Es el centro de operaciones para explorar una especie de mundo perdido de esos que aún quedan, un paraíso natural que recibe ya 12 millones de turistas al año, 10 de ellos llegados de la propia China. Lo explica Lu Jing, vicepresidenta de Turismo de Yangshuo, satisfecha porque la cifra se ha triplicado respecto a los 4 millones de turis- tas recibidos en el 2005, pero consciente del reto que ese crecimiento comporta. “ Contamos con 60.000 plazas hoteleras y estamos potenciando la creación de alojamientos rurales para dar cabida a toda la demanda. El mayor problema al que nos enfrentamos es el tratamiento de las aguas residuales, pero el Gobierno ha anunciado ya una gran inversión para solucionarlo ”, señala. “ Y seguimos muy de cerca – añade – el sistema de análisis de la Organización Mundial del Turismo (OMT) para controlar cuándo estamos llegando al tope anual de visitantes que podemos absorber”.\nEN EL ‘ TOP TEN’Guilin y Yangshuo, en la región de Guangxi, son destinos favoritos del turista chino\n\nSHELLY, PIONERA DEL SECTOR “ La llegada de los primeros extranjeros en los años setenta nos abrió al mundo ”\n\nChen Xiuying, Shelly para sus huéspedes, es una veterana del sector turístico de Yangshuo y probablemente la primera que aprendió el inglés. Suya es la primera casa rural de la zona, que abrió en los años 70, cuando llegaron los primeros extranjeros, y donde se instaló en el 2005 el primer centro de la OMT de China.\nA Shelly le gusta improvisar canciones de bienvenida para los turistas y mostrar un álbum de fotos repleto de visitas ilustres y de historia. “ Es una de mis mejores ayudantes, aprendió inglés muy rápido e hizo carrera ”, explica ante la imagen de una joven de cara avispada, peinada con una trenza y la vestimenta de otros tiempos, gorra y uniforme comunista.\nShelly tiene muy claro que el turismo ha sido un gran motor de progreso para Yangshuo y sus habitantes, y no sólo económico.\n“ La llegada de extranjeros, la mayoría mochileros de Europa y Estados Unidos, nos abrió todo un mundo nuevo. No cambiaría mi experiencia por nada”.\nApertura al mundo, creación de empleo, consumo, desarrollo económico ... Todo son ventajas, y sin embargo el visitante extranjero no puede evitar temer por el futuro del paraíso teniendo en mente los problemas que una excesiva presión turística comporta. Las propias autoridades chinas se han visto obligadas a admitirlo en el caso de una atracción turística muchísimo más popular, la Gran Muralla. Construida para frenar a los ejércitos enemigos, hoy son hordas de turistas las que la ocupan. Algunas partes de la muralla han sido pintadas con graffiti y según el Beijing Times, un 30 % de la fortificación ha desaparecido como consecuencia de la erosión natural y de la presión humana de millones de visitantes al año.\nHoy por hoy, sin embargo, la apuesta por potenciar el crecimiento turístico de la zona de Guilin parece clara. La estación del AVE de Yangshuo estará lista a finales de año y el tren parará directamente allí. Todo va muy deprisa, tanto que uno puede encontrarse viajando por la provincia de Guilin con una flamante estación de AVE a la que se debe llegar siguiendo una pista de tierra. Habrá una carretera, pero no ha habido tiempo de acabarla aún. Frente al modernísimo y aséptico edificio de la estación, una decena de tenderetes improvisados ofrecen todo tipo de comida tradicional al viajero: el contraste no puede ser mayor.\nPAISAJE PURO Las terrazas de arroz de Longsheng o un crucero por el río Li son un viaje al pasado\n\nLA TERCERA HERMANA LIU Con escenografía de Zhang Yimou, es un espectáculo imprescindible\n\nPara algunos, de hecho, una mejora de las conexiones viarias es imprescindible para potenciar Guilin como un destino turístico mayor. Es la opinión de Tony Jiang, director general de Intertrips, la filial en España del turoperador Wenjing Global, mayorista especializada en viajes a China y desde China. Camino de las terrazas de arroz de Longsheng, otro de los puntos fuertes de Guilin, Jiang asegura que en cualquier caso el principal problema para la llegada de españoles sigue siendo la tardanza en la concesión de visados, entre cinco días y una semana. “ Es el problema que dificulta la llegada de turistas chinos a España, porque optan antes por ir a Francia, Alemania o el Reino Unido, donde todo es más rápido ”, explica. En reciprocidad, China también aplica esos 5-7 días de plazo para que los españoles obtengan su visado.\nLongsheng, 100 kilómetros al norte de la ciudad de Guilin, unas dos horas en autocar, es también un viaje al pasado, a la emoción del paisaje puro, esta vez formado por terrazas dibujadas en la montaña para el cultivo del arroz hace unos 700 años. Estamos a más de 1.000 metros de altitud y un teleférico construido hace sólo cinco años facilita la llegada a la cima para observar el escenario en todo su esplendor, aunque los puristas pueden optan por el ascenso a pie en otros puntos. El color de Longsheng, o Longji (el espinazo del dragón), pasa del blanco al azul, plata, amarillo, verde ... dependiendo de la estación y lo convierte en una de las zonas turísticas más valoradas de China.\nEn la ruta hacia Longsheng, es parada obligada la visita a alguna de las aldeas de la etnia Yao, con sus mujeres de pelo larguísimo que recogen en complicados moños. La región de Guangxi tiene una gran diversidad étnico-lingüística y las visitas a aldeas de las minorías son interesantes. Los Yao, Dong, Miao, Zhuang ... son famosos por sus atuendos típicos y sus actuaciones musicales, que los turistas chinos valoran especialmente. Pero si hay una representación a destacar es la de Liu San Jie (La tercera hermana Liu), en Yangshuo. Una maravilla basada en una leyenda de la etnia Zhuang, con una escenografía espectacular obra del renombrado director de cine Zhang Yimou.\nMúsica, luz y color al aire libre, con el paisaje como fondo natural y 600 actores y actrices en escena.\nNo hay que perdérsela.\n   \n"

It is considered a pocket of peace and tranquillity, offering its visitors the opportunity to hike, cycle and inline skate, while taking in the area's natural beauty. But that's not all: Other activities/attractions include parks, play areas, a golf course, a scaling wall, an educational farm, canoe courses, ‘adventureland' and… the opportunity to go skiing at Snowplanet.

"Places togo Thailand","Khao Yai National Park","Khao Yai National Park\nMooiste plekken in Thailand - De natuur in! Bezoek tijdens een rondreis Khao Yai National Park, een van de mooiste en oudste natuurgebieden van Thailand.\nKhao Yai Nationaal Park\nOp ongeveer 180 km ten noordoosten van Bangkok ligt dit fraaie nationaal park. Khao Yai, dat door de UNESCO werd uitgeroepen tot werelderfgoed, bestaat grotendeels uit regenwoud, maar heeft ook bergen van ruim 1000 meter. Tijdens een natuurvakantie in Thailand mag Khao Yai niet ontbreken op het reisprogramma!\n\nInformatie over Khao Yai\nVerspreid over de provincies Nakhon Nayok, Prachin Buri, Nakhon Ratchasima en Saraburi in het oosten van Thailand, is het park bijna 2200 vierkante kilometer groot. In het natuurgebied ontspringen verschillende rivieren en het tropische regenwoud biedt een prachtige verscheidenheid aan planten en wildlife. Het hoogste punt van het park is de Khao Rom top op 1.351 meter boven zeeniveau. Andere hoge punten zijn onder meer de Khao Lame op 1.326 meter en Khao Kiew op 1.292 meter. In het noorden, oosten en zuiden van Khao Yai liggen berggebieden met hellingen naar de zuidkant. Dit zorgt ervoor dat er maar liefst vijf belangrijke waterwegen vanuit Khao Yai ontspringen, waaronder de Prachinburi River en Nakhon Nayok River. De rivieren spelen op zowel economisch als sociaal niveau een belangrijke rol in de regio.\n\nKhao Yai - dieren\n\nKhao Yai National Park is een van de weinige natuurgebieden ter wereld waar nog tijgers in het wild leven. De kans dat je deze roofdieren ziet tijdens de reis is echter miniem, maar je zult wel vele andere dieren in het wild waarnemen, zoals olifanten, beren, apen en neushoornvogels. Wil je er zeker van zijn dat je niet te veel dieren mist, bezoek Khao Yai dan onder begeleiding van een gids. Ervaren gidsen weten precies waar de dieren zich bevinden op welk tijdstip van de dag en bezorgen je een onvergetelijke excursie. Mocht je er toch zelf op uit trekken zonder gids in Khao Yai, houd er dan rekening mee dat je rond zonsopgang en -ondergang de meeste kans hebt om wildlife en vogels te spotten. Draag een lange broek en extra speciale sokken tegen bloedzuigers. Nog een tip: 10 km buiten het park bevindt zich een grot waar iedere avond om 17u30 miljoenen vleermuizen uit komen vliegen, een spectaculair natuurfenomeen! Wie van vogels houdt, kan de informatie over een vogelreis naar Thailand lezen.\n\nReistip: safari Khao Yai - Thailand Online\n\nExcursies Khao Yai National Park\nWat is er te doen in Khao Yai? Naast het observeren van wilde dieren kan je er deelnemen aan leuke activiteiten en excursies, zoals raften, mountainbiken en wandelen; vanaf het bezoekerscentrum leiden 5 bewegwijzerde paden door de jungle van het nationaal park. Het meest bewandelde pad is een 5,5 km lange wandelroute van Dong Tiew naar een uitkijktoren. Hier zie je met een beetje geluk olifanten bij de ""salt licks"", beddingen waar de dieren komen om zout te likken. Trail 9 is het minst bewandelde pad en geeft iets meer zekerheid om dieren te zien. Verscheidene trektochten worden georganiseerd in het park. Verder heeft Khao Yai een aantal schitterende watervallen. De Namtok Heo Suwat waterval bijvoorbeeld, die diende als filmlocatie voor The Beach. In het poeltje onderaan de waterval kan je heerlijk zwemmen. Ook de Haew Narok Waterfalls zijn prachtig. Tot slot is er de mogelijkheid om deel te nemen aan een nachtsafari. Tijdens een nachtelijke tour zie je misschien wel enkele van de meest zeldzame dieren die leven in het Khao Yai national Park.\nReis naar Khao Yai\nKhao Yai National Park lig ten noordoosten van Bangkok en is een kleine 3 uur rijden. Het park is per trein, bus of minivan goed te bereiken vanuit de stad. De makkelijkste en leukste manier is met de bus vanaf Bangkok (je zit dan volop tussen de locals), maar je kunt ook een bezoek aan het park boeken als bouwsteen, een reis naar Thailand op maat laten uitstippelen of aan een groepsreis langs Khao Yai deelnemen; Djoser organiseert een prachtige rondreis door Thailand, met een verblijf van 3 dagen in het Khao Yai National Park. Bekijk het aanbod van betrouwbare touroperators en reisorganisaties waar wij mee samenwerken. Een volledig overzicht van alle reizen vind je op onze informatiepagina over de mooiste plekken in Thailand.\nBezoek aan het nationaal park\nKhao Yai kan je op meerdere manieren bezoeken. Te voet zijn er verschillende hiking trails te volgen. De meeste paden zijn te bewandelen vanaf de accomodaties aan de voet van het park, waaronder een trail naar de Heo Suwat waterval, bekend van de film ""The Beach"" met Leonardo Di Caprio. Een andere manier om het park te bezoeken is per auto of 4WD. Van noord naar zuid loop een weg die het mogelijk maakt om alle highlights van het park mee te pakken. Avontuurlijker is om een brommer of motor te huren en daar het park mee door te cruisen. Liever alles erop en eraan? Dan is een georganiseerde tour een leuke optie."

"Places of interest","Музей Матисса MUST","Eжедневно с 10.00 до 18.00, вторник - выходной. Free.\n\nМузей французского художника Анри Матисса достоин особого внимания. Попав сюда, стоит обязательно перекинуться словечком со здешним смотрителем. Он расскажет о Матиссе то, чего не прочитаешь в книгах. Он считает музей не просто выставкой картин, а своего рода домом великого мастера.Экспозиция включает не только его полотна, но и личные вещи мастера. Само здание музея не что иное, как генуэзская вилла XVII века, а здешняя экспозиция целиком и полностью посвящена французской Ривьере. В общей сложности Матисс провел в Ницце около 40 лет своей жизни. Поднимаясь по тропинке на холм, на котором расположился музей, любопытный путник не пройдет мимо небольшого отеля под названием «Регина». Здесь Матисс провел последние годы жизни. И часто виды на город из его окна вдохновляли художника на новые работы.После экскурсии по музею все обычно идут в монастырь Нотр-Дам-де-Симиз, что находится неподалеку. Здесь на местном кладбище и похоронен Анри Матисс.\n\nЭто интересно - Анри Матисс начинал как маргинальных художник. Прославился тем, что виртуозно обращался с цветом и формой. Великого живописца из него сделал русский меценат Сергей Щукин, который заказал малоизвестному тогда художнику скандальные панно «Танец» и «Музыка» и заплатил за них баснословные по тем временам деньги.\n"

"Places to visit","Hyde park - Diana memorial fountain","Opening times\nApril - August: 10.00 - 20.00 \nSeptember: 10.00 - 19.00 \nMarch and October: 10.00 - 18.00 \nNovember - February: 10.00 - 16.00\n\nThe fountain was built with the best materials, talent and technology. It contains 545 pieces of Cornish granite - each shaped by the latest computer-controlled machinery and pieced together using traditional skills.\n\nThe design aims to reflect Diana's life, water flows from the highest point in two directions as it cascades, swirls and bubbles before meeting in a calm pool at the bottom. The water is constantly being refreshed and is drawn from London's water table.\n\nThe Memorial also symbolises Diana's quality and openness. There are three bridges where you can cross the water and go right to the heart of the fountain. We hope visitors will feel at home when they visit this special place.\n\nInformation for visitors to the Memorial\nThe Memorial has a path suitable for wheelchairs.\nThe area is supervised when open.\nPlease feel free to sit on the edge of the Memorial and refresh your feet.\nWe ask visitors not to walk on the Memorial.\nDogs are not permitted into the area, except for registered assistance dogs.\nThe area may be closed off during extremely cold or severe weather conditions."

At both the original neighborhood favorite and the new, equally charming Santa Monica location, you can feast on the new three-course prix fixe menu on Sundays and Mondays for $40 (!!!!) per person, which is a big deal because, well, totally-worth-it dinner here usually isn't $40 per person.

Performers literally dance on water in this production from acclaimed film director (and creator of the 2008 Beijing Olympics Opening Ceremony) Zhang Yimou. Stop by the Longjing Tea Plantation to sample one of the world’s finest brews and bring back samples as souvenirs."

"Places of interest","Кладбище Шато","Начиная с X века на холме Шато (или холме Замка) текла размеренная городская жизнь. Здесь возвышался замок, собор и множество жилых домов. На горе жить было безопаснее, ведь с нее открывался прекрасный обзор во все стороны, врагов можно было заметить заранее. Однако со временем народ стал спускаться с холма и строить дома на побережье. В период с XVI по XVIII век жители Ниццы практически оставили холм, а замок был разрушен в 1706 году.\n\nБывший жилой квартал в нижней части холма во второй половине XVIII века решено было отдать под кладбище. Со временем оно превратилось в некрополь, где стали хоронить знаменитостей, знатных жителей города, представителей русских, английских и французских аристократических семейств.\n\nНапример, здесь находятся могилы журналиста, писателя, автора «Призрака Оперы» Гастона Леру, а также основателя автомобильной марки Мерседес Эмиля Еллинека и его дочери.\n\nВыделяется среди прочих могила русского публициста и философа Александра Герцена, который в 1850 году поселился в Ницце.

Stolové hory, dawn. Hejšovina) – masyw górski w Sudetach Środkowych, na styku z Sudetami Wschodnimi. Wypiętrzone przed 30 milionami lat są jednymi z nielicznych w Europie gór płytowych. Płyty z górnokredowych piaskowców ciosowych ułożone są poziomo – stąd nazwa gór, bo płaskie jak stół. Zachodnia część Gór Stołowych leży na terenie Czech i nosi nazwę Broumovská vrchovina. Północno-zachodni skraj pasma w okolicach Mieroszowa – Gorzeszowa – Krzeszowa – Chełmska – Okrzeszyna nosi nazwę Zaworów. W 1993 na terenie Gór Stołowych utworzono Park Narodowy Gór Stołowych.\n\nSpis treści\n [ukryj] 1 Podział\n\n1.1 Administracyjny\n1.2 Pasma i ich najwyższe punkty\n\n2 Geologia\n\n2.1 Budowa\n2.2 Rozwój rzeźby\n2.3 Surowce mineralne\n\n3 Wody\n\n3.1 Europejski dział wód\n3.2 Wody powierzchniowe\n3.3 Wody podziemne\n3.4 Wody mineralne\n\n4 Klimat\n5 Flora\n\n5.1 Lasy\n5.2 Łąki\n5.3 Roślinność naskalna\n\n5.3.... \nhttps://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B3ry_Sto%C5%82owe"

"Places to go, things to do","small ship cruises","Dear Mr. potgieter,\n\nI'd like to start this week's newsletter with money-saving offers that we've negotiated with Royal Caribbean, Oceania, Silversea and Paul Gauguin Cruises. They include shipboard credits, which are as good as cash on the ship and can be used toward onboard purchases not covered in the cruise fare, such as shore excursions and spa treatments.\n\nRoyal Caribbean is offering our customers discounts of up to 79% and exclusive shipboard credits of up to $175 per cabin on nearly every remaining cruise and cruise tour in 2015. Click here for dates and prices.\n\nOceania is offering Vacations To Go customers huge discounts -- save up to 79% -- plus receive exclusive shipboard credits of up to $1,050 per cabin on select sailings. Free Internet and free prepaid gratuities also apply to certain departures. And, on select itineraries in Africa, receive a free safari. Click here for dates and prices.\n\nSilversea has slashed its best available rates by up to 50% exclusively for Vacations To Go customers -- it's the best offer we've seen from this line in several years. Book by June 17. Fares include onboard gratuities, complimentary beverages (including wine and spirits) and butler service. Click here for dates and prices.\n\nPaul Gauguin Cruises is offering our customers fantastic discounts and newly reduced rates on a variety of sailings from now through 2016 -- save up to 77%. Click here for dates and prices.\n\nAs always, these offers are for new bookings only and subject to availability. Restrictions may apply.\n________________________________________\n\nI often hear from readers who want to cruise aboard a small ship, one with fewer passengers (500 or under, for example). These vessels offer a more intimate onboard experience and more personalized service.\n\nBecause of their small size, they can drop anchor in small harbors and coves and call at seaside towns that larger ships can't access. They often offer unique, interesting itineraries. Several lines, particularly those that specialize in expedition cruising, include shore excursions in the fare.\n\nThe ships themselves are easy to navigate -- after a day or two on board, you likely won't have any problems remembering where the dining room is, or where to go to disembark the ship.\n\nSpeaking of disembarkation, it's much quicker on a small ship with fewer passengers to process, as is check-in and embarkation.\n\nYou'll get to know your fellow travelers and crew. On Windstar trips, for example, guests are welcome to visit the bridge, and on SeaDream sailings in the Mediterranean, there are opportunities to go ashore with the chef to shop the markets. On cruises with Swan Hellenic and Voyages to Antiquity, you can chat with expert lecturers -- diplomats, archaeologists, historians and others.\n\nSmall-ship cruising may not be for everyone, of course. Families with young children won't always find dedicated youth facilities, programs or counselors. Onboard recreation and entertainment can be limited -- no water parks, flashy Broadway-style productions or day-to-night organized activities.\n\nBut there likely will be low-key musical entertainment, a full spa or spa services of some sort, cozy lounges and inviting outdoor deck spaces for stretching out with a good book.\n\nWe represent 18 lines that operate ships with maximum passenger capacities of 500 guests or fewer. They include expedition ships, masted sailing ships, six-star luxury vessels and sleek yachts. I've listed all of them below -- click the links for itineraries, dates and rates.\n\nAmerican Cruise Lines has ships that carry 49 to 104 travelers on itineraries in Alaska, New England, the Pacific Northwest and other U.S. locales.\n\nThe 88-guest vessels of Blount Small Ship Adventures have shallow drafts that allow them to sail in less than 7 feet of water and retractable pilot houses that enable them to slip under low bridges. Each also has a bow ramp, so guests can disembark right onto the shore.\n\nCelebrity has one small ship, the 98-guest Celebrity Xpedition, and it cruises the wildlife-rich Galapagos Islands year-round. I sailed aboard the Xpedition and thought it was a very comfortable and upscale ship, one of the best in the region.\n\nHaimark Line accommodates 210 guests on the recently refurbished MS Saint Laurent, which ventures to the Caribbean, Panama Canal, South America and Canada/New England.\n\nHebridean Island Cruises operates a 50-passenger vessel that calls at off-the-beaten-path ports in the British Isles.\n\nHurtigruten sails the Norwegian coast and to Antarctica and the Arctic. Three ships have small passenger capacities: Nordstjernen (290 guests), Fram (318) and Lofoten (400).\n\nThe 10 ships of Lindblad Expeditions carry 28 to 148 travelers. Most embark on expedition-style cruises, but the sailing ship Sea Cloud -- built in 1931 by financier E.F. Hutton and his cereal heiress wife, Marjorie Merriweather Post -- offers leisurely cruises in the Caribbean and Mediterranean.\n\nPaul Gauguin Cruises welcomes 332 guests aboard the Paul Gauguin for cruises of French Polynesia from Tahiti. Meanwhile, the smaller 88-passenger Tere Moana explores the Caribbean, Mediterranean and Central America.\n\nPearl Seas Cruises launched the new 210-passenger Pearl Mist last year; all cabins have private balconies. It currently sails in Canada/New England, the Caribbean and the Panama Canal.\n\nFrench company Ponant Yacht Cruises operates four 264-guest ships and one 64-passenger ship, providing a casually elegant ambience and gourmet cuisine.\n\nQuark Expeditions carries 78 to 199 adventurous travelers to Antarctica and the Arctic on its ships, which sport ice-strengthened hulls for navigating polar waters.\n\nSix-star line Regent has one ship that accommodates 490 guests, the Seven Seas Navigator. It sails to a variety of destinations, including Alaska, the Caribbean and the Mediterranean.\n\nSeabourn also provides luxury, six-star voyages on its all-suite, 450-passenger ships, which boast a yacht-like atmosphere and claim a high ratio of space per guest.\n\nHighlights of cruising aboard the 112-guest yachts of SeaDream include the alfresco Balinese Beds, raised above the ship's railing for unobstructed views, and the Champagne and Caviar Splash, a beloved ritual on Caribbean cruises.\n\nSeven of the eight ships of Silversea have small passenger capacities, ranging from 100 to 382. These luxury, six-star vessels sail worldwide -- in Alaska, Asia, the Arctic, the Galapagos, Europe and more.\n\nSwan Hellenic sails the 350-guest Minerva to unique destinations, calling its onboard style ""British country elegance.""\n\nThe Aegean Odyssey carries up to 378 culturally curious travelers on cruises for Voyages to Antiquity. This line focuses on the history, art and traditions of destinations in Asia, Europe and more.\n\nWindstar cruises has long been popular for its three sleek sailing ships (148 to 310 guests) and recently expanded to include three 212-passenger power yachts. All boast water-sports platforms at the stern for windsurfing, sailing and other activities. Offering a casually elegant experience, Windstar sails to alluring destinations like Tahiti and the Greek Isles. All voyages feature a complimentary onshore ""Private Event"" -- dine under the stars amid the splendid ruins of Ephesus or join a wine tasting with lunch in Sicily."

In effetti la sua posizione, in una piazzetta chiusa da cui si diramano stradine tortuose animate dalle bancarelle fin dalle prime ore del mattino, dà al mercato della Vucciria quel surplus scenografico che manca agli altri mercati storici della città (Ballarò, Porta Carini/Il Capo), seppur forse mantenutisi ancora più autentici.\n\n \n\n"

Its a quick jaunt from most places in the US...Eat and drink to your hearts content  along beach front restaurants, while away on gorgeous beaches, make out in romantic carriage rides down cobblestone streets or just get away from it all—an hour boat ride away is Rosario Island, a sleepy island surrounded by warm turquoise waters. And if you get bored, remember that the Colombian people invented Salsa.\n\nThanks to www.discoveringice.com for the pic!"

The square is a good place to watch ferries ply across the harbour but plan a trip here early in the morning or late in the evening when the sun is at its least intense."

I guess I will try to order these in kind of the order I think it would be good to see them in and then as we get more sure of what we want to do we can set the order more firmly and start to add notes to each place we want to go to say what we want to do there.\n\nI also think that once we sure things up more we should put due dates on everything that will correspond to when we will be in each place, because it turns out you can't actually order things that well with Wunderlist.\n\nThis is going to be a fun trip :)"

"Places of interest","Цветочный парк «Феникс»","Территория этого парка огромна и занимает площадь размером с 65 футбольных полей. Кроме огромного количества фонтанов, в том числе и поющих, аккуратных лужаек, искусственных и естественных озер с десятками видов редких орхидей, «Феникс» может похвастать самой большой в Европе теплицей со стеклянным куполом.\nЭто своего рода планета в миниатюре, потому что, побывав в каждой из 7 зон, где поддерживаются условия тропического климата, можно с уверенностью сказать, что посетил Мексику, Южную Африку, Австралию, Испанию, Грецию, Ближний Восток, Канарские острова и т.д.\nОдин из самых популярных аттракционов в теплице – Джунгли бабочек. Здесь часто случаются стихийные соревнования, на кого усядется больше насекомых. Дети визжат от восторга, а взрослые от умиления\nНастоящей гордостью парка является теплица «Зеленый алмаз» (7 тыс. кв.м.), которая считается одной из самых больших на территории Европы. Не менее интересен в парке и  небольшой домик, выполненный в провансальском стиле и окруженный стройными кипарисами и благоухающими оливковыми деревьями.\n\nПарк Феникс расположен по адресу Promenade des Anglais, 405. Доехать до него можно на автобусах №9,10 (остановка Arena). Парк открыт для посетителей ежедневно, с 9.30 до 20.00 (с октября по апрель с 9.30 до 17.00). Вход на его территорию платный. Стоимость входного билета составляет 3 евро."
