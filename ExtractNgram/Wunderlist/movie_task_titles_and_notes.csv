"Movies to Watch","Women's","И вы не поверите, но они необязательно про любовь. Они многогранны и непредсказуемы, как и сам прекрасный пол. Список составлен сайтом AdMe.ru.\n \nМои черничные ночи\n\nРежиссеру Вонг Кар-Ваю удалось снять ""черничный"" в каждом своем кадре фильм. Отличная игра актеров, бесподобная работа оператора создают эффект легкой нереальности происходящего, словно сидишь ночью, сонный, в баре и ешь черничный пирог. И, конечно, не можем не упомянуть музыку, без которой фильм потерял бы значительную часть очарования.\n \nМосква слезам не верит\n\nЭта кинолента Владимира Меньшова - общепризнанный культовый шедевр, чуть ли не лучший фильм за всю историю СССР и самый любимый фильм женщин всего постсоветского пространства. Секрет его прост: близкая всем история показана жизненно, без пафоса и преувеличений, искренне и по-доброму. С предостаточной долей хорошего юмора и замечательных фраз, уже разлетевшихся на цитаты.\n \nМачеха\n\n""Мачеха"" - фильм о сильных чувствах, материнстве, преданности и обстоятельствах, с которыми сложно совладать, но если это удается, то весь мир говорит нам спасибо. Тонкая нить драмы завязывается в клубок, обнажая сложные и противоречивые характеры главных героев в блестящем исполнении Сьюзан Сарандон и Джулии Робертс.\n \nРазрисованная вуаль\n\nТихая деревушка, потерянная среди гор. Эпидемия холеры, безжалостно забирающая жизни людей. Эдварт Нортон и Наоми Уоттс, бесподобно сыгравшие Уолтера и Китти. История их любви несколько иная, чем та, которую описал Сомерсет Моэм в своем романе, но она по-своему привлекательна. Фильм идеален ""от"" и ""до"", и каждая деталь в нем дает понять, что истинная любовь не та, что рождается в мимолетной вспышке страсти любовников, но та, которая возникает в стремлении партнеров понять друг друга и самих себя.\n \nЧасы\n\n""Часы"" - неоднозначный, непостижимо глубокий фильм-водоворот. Фильм-откровение. Фильм-загадка, коих немало скрывается в женской душе. Режиссер и актеры не пытаются угодить зрителю и сделать свое высказывание понятнее. Они хотят, чтобы люди, считающие себя несчастными, задумались: ""Может, счастье рядом?"" А люди, считающие себя счастливыми, подумали о том, счастливы ли они.\n \nЖестокий романс\n\nНе каждый решится взять на себя экранизацию классики, поскольку очень сложно перенести на экран всю чувственность, красоту, мудрость великого произведения. Но Эльдару Рязанову удалось то, что удается далеко не каждому, - сделать фильм ярче литературного произведения. Благодаря актерам, декорациям и, конечно, музыке пьеса Островского заиграла новыми красками, а русский кинематограф получил в свою коллекцию одну из самых колоритных актрис - Ларису Гузееву.\n \nДневник Бриджит Джонс\n\nНаслаждаться историей обычной девушки Бриджит Джонс, которая смело наряжается в костюм кролика и при этом мало заморачивается над тем, что подумают о ней окружающие, можно бесконечное число раз. Особенно укутавшись в плед, с большой кружкой какао и сладостями.\n \nУ зеркала два лица\n\nНевероятно добрый фильм с прекрасными актерами и занимательным сюжетом. Великолепной актрисе Барбре Стрейзанд удалось срежиссировать и сыграть удивительно жизненную и позитивную во всех отношениях историю любви, которая радует и глаза, и слух, и сердце.\n \nВлюбись в меня, если осмелишься\n\nЭто фильм-игра, непринужденный, легкий и очень жизненный. Нетипичная история, нетипичное поведение героев. Не разобрать - это их действия слишком жестокие, или же чувства слишком сильные. В нем не нужно искать причин, объяснений, последовательности, логичной концовки - для каждого они свои. Лучше просто смотреть и чувствовать.\n \nМой единственный\n\nЗамечательный фильм для живых духом людей. Сюжет настолько насыщен и колоритен персонажами разных мастей, что действительно чувствуешь пряный аромат жизни с экрана. Благо, что история Анн Деверо, которая не научилась быть хорошей матерью двум своим сыновьям, но хотя бы пытается, не изобилует нравоучениями, а просто демонстрирует, каким все является в жизни.\n \nВ постели с врагом\n\nДля одних стеклянный дом на берегу озера - это мечта, для других - золотая клетка, выбраться из которой можно только начав жизнь с чистого листа. Как раз об этом триллер ""В постели с врагом"", который благодаря впечатляющей игре Джулии Робертс и Патрика Бергина и атмосферному саундтреку смотрится на одном дыхании.\n \nАнглийский пациент\n\n""Мы истинные страны, а не те, что начертаны на картах"". Режиссер Энтони Мингелла создал не просто фильм, а путеводитель, своеобразный справочник по жизни, ошибкам и, конечно, любви. Вас захватят уже первые его кадры: крохотный самолетик летит над бескрайней пустыней. Так же и люди летят сквозь пространство времени и событий, пытаются приземлиться и часто терпят крушение.\n \nУнесенные ветром\n\nЕсть хорошие фильмы, а есть просто шедевры, и именно к ним относится фильм ""Унесенные ветром"". Его можно пересматривать вечно и каждый раз находить для себя что-то новое в этой невероятной истории о сильной духом женщине, которая не была похожа на других и справлялась с такими ударами судьбы, с коими не совладали бы даже некоторые мужчины.\n \nЖареные зеленые помидоры\n\nХорошая добротная картина из тех, что оставляют след и свет в душе. В ней обычное и рутинное переплетается с каким-то бытовым волшебством, которое в быстротечности серых будней не замечается, но оно достойно восхищения. Так ненавязчиво и вкрадчиво фильм проникает глубоко-глубоко, но не заставляет нарыв ""кипеть"" или ""стынуть"" от ужаса. Смотрите и наслаждайтесь каждым моментом этого атмосферного фильма.\n \nЧтец\n\nЭто один из тех немногочисленных фильмов, за событиями которого ты наблюдаешь тихо и растворяешься. В картине мастерски переплелись личная драма и глобальные проблемы послевоенного времени. Поэтому без симпатий и антипатий здесь можно вселиться в героя, прожить его жизнь за два часа киноленты и со стороны понаблюдать, как через историю нескольких судеб творится история целой эпохи. И, да, Кейт Уинслет здесь божественна.\n \nИскупление\n\n""Искупление"" - это атмосферная история о любви и ненависти, страсти и обреченности, желании и надежде, родстве и предательстве с талантливыми актерами, которые не побоялись обнажить душу. Весь фильм вас будет сопровождать великолепная музыка, и кажется, что извучит она откуда-то изнутри. После просмотра не ждите открытых эмоций. Скорее, что-то изменится в мыслях, во взгляде, потому что такие картины не проходят бесследно.\n \nТрещины\n\nТрещины - маленькие разломы на гладком полотне наших судеб. Одни трещинки остаются с нами навсегда, создавая причудливый узор, другие разбивают вдребезги наши сердца, души и жизни. Именно о таких роковых трещинах идет речь в этом фильме, в котором создатели показали скрытый от глаз женский мир, весь наполненный ожиданием взрослой жизни, тайнами, временами вырывающимися наружу, и влюбленностями.\n \nБелый Олеандр\n\nЭтот фильм можно начать смотреть совсем случайно, но поймать себя на мысли, что оторваться от экрана невозможно, - подобно ядовитому, но прекрасному белому олеандру кино дурманит и захватывает своей атмосферой. Характеры персонажей здесь максимально обострены, как бритвы, но особенно - мать и дочь, которые словно ходят по краю, смертельные и притягательные.\n \nВсе о моей матери\n\nПедро Альмодовар в этой картине показал нам частичку своего видения мира, свое отношение к женщинам, которых он очень любит и снимает так, как не умеет больше никто. Каждая женщина в этом фильме незаурядна - ярка, как редкая пестрая птица. Очаровывает их искренность и какая-то безыскусность, но в хорошем смысле. Кажется, это даже не фильм вовсе, а сама жизнь.\n \nБлизость\n\nЭто чувственная картина, заставляющая задумчиво и восхищенно улыбаться. Переплетение эмоций героев, яркость, живость, значимость диалогов и осязаемость этой истории - драмы четверых жаждущих любви людей - создают непреодолимое желание дотронуться до каждого героя и признаться им в любви. Потому что каждый из нас прекрасен: в своей радости, в своей печали, в счастье и в раздумьях."

"Movies to Watch","10 бизнес фильмов","Итак, мой выбор ТОП — 10 лучших «бизнес»-фильмов:\n\n1. Человек,который изменил всё\n\nФильм о бейсбольной команде и ее генеральном менеджере. Очень ярко показывает, что для того, чтобы достичь нужных результатов, главное — не лучшие люди и большие деньги, а правильные инструменты и грамотное управление теми ресурсами, что есть. Фильм очень близок по тематике с моими принципами управления, поэтому я и поставил его на первое место.\n\n2. Бойлерная\n\nДля меня главное в этом фильме было то, что я впервые увидел модель работающего отдела продаж. Пропускайте мимо внимания то, что они продают «некачественный» продукт. Обращайте внимание на то, как они это делают.\n\n3. Триумф\n\nФильм о том, как любой человек с поддержкой наставника может победить. Действие разворачивается в 1913 году, во время чемпионата по гольфу. Неизвестный молодой аутсайдер совершает невероятное – побеждает абсолютного лидера и чемпиона. Это фильм больше о принципах, придерживаясь которых, вы сможете также добиться триумфа в бизнесе.\n\n4. Продавец\n\nФильм, который покажет вам как продавцы могут делать, казалось бы, чудеса. Комедия , в которой продавец должен продать в день Независимости 211 автомобилей. Шаг за шагом рассказывает, как знание психологии помогает в бизнесе и продажах. Показано множество фишек, которые повторить, конечно, сложно, но смоделировать реально.\n\n5. Уолл-стрит\n\nФильм о том, что перед нами всегда стоит выбор. В фильме герою нужно выбирать между моральным и этическим воспитанием, которое дал ему отец, и привлекательностью богатства и могущества, которые воплощает в себе его руководитель. Заставляет очень сильно задуматься\n\n6. Американцы\n\nОчень хороший пример того, как можно в короткий срок получить нужные результаты, зажав людей между положительной и отрицательной мотивацией. Очень много готовых идей, которые просто бери и внедряй.\n\n7. Пираты Силиконовой долины\n\nФильм о двух бизнесменах-стартаперах — Билле Гейтсе и Стиве Джобсе. Два разных характера, два разных подхода к ведению бизнеса. Очень точно показан путь развития двух великих IT-компаний и соперничество двух самых успешных технологических предпринимателей современности.\n\n8. Социальная сеть\n\nО том, что не обязательно иметь хорошую идею. Намного важнее делать конкретные действия, много действий, чтобы идея стала реальностью.\n\n9. Атлант  расправил плечи\n\nНе такой как книга, но для тех, кому лень читать, подойдет. Фильм о том, что именно такие как мы, кто берет ответственность за себя, своих сотрудников, свою страну, и двигают этот мир вперед. Кто, если не мы?!\n\n10. Мирный воин\n\nВообще не про бизнес, а про спорт. Однако давайте вспомним, что бизнес – это тоже игра, только не на очки, а на деньги. Про то, что нужно вставать и идти вперед, чтобы ни случилось!\n\nПросто смотри, выбирай нужное и внедряй. И не забудь поделиться этим списком со своими друзьями, нажав  на кнопки социальных сетей.\n\nВерю в ваш успех! "

The film stars Sienna Miller as Tippi Hedren and Toby Jones as Alfred Hitchcock. It is based on Donald Spoto's 2009 book, Spellbound by Beauty: Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading Ladies, which discusses British-born film director Hitchcock and the women who played leading roles in his films. The Girl's title was inspired by Hitchcock's alleged nickname for Hedren.\nThe film depicts Hitchcock's alleged obsession with Hedren, the American model and actress he brought from relative obscurity to star in his 1963 film The Birds. Hitchcock becomes infatuated with his leading lady; when she rebuffs his advances, he subjects her to a series of traumatic experiences during the filming of The Birds. Hitchcock's obsession with Hedren continues when she stars in his next production, Marnie. Hedren grows increasingly uncomfortable with his attentions, and decides that... \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_(2012_HBO_film)"

"Movies to Watch","Gerry","\n\n 49. Gerry (2002)\n\n\n After his dabbling in Hollywood (or at least Indiewood) projects hit bottom with Finding Forrester, director Gus Van Sant went through a kind of artistic detox that resulted in a series of dream-like minimalist films that cut against the grain and revitalized his career. The first of a “death trilogy” that concluded with Elephant and Last Days, Van Sant’s Gerry proceeds from a simple, seven-word premise: “Two guys get lost in the desert.” Though Van Sant is making a statement about modern man’s disconnection from nature, Gerry works mainly as a hypnotic and beautifully abstracted exercise in style, with carefully composed landscapes and soundscapes that draw receptive viewers into a unique headspace. Each sequence has its own topographical marvels, but the film is also surprisingly hilarious at times, suggesting a cross between Samuel Beckett and Abbott & Costello. \n"

Both are cultured intellectuals with an all-embracing passion for music, literature and science, who have evolved to a level where they no longer kill for sustenance, but still retain their innate wildness. Their love story has endured several centuries but their debauched idyll is threatened by the uninvited arrival of Eve’s carefree little sister Ava (Mia Wasikowska) who hasn’t yet learned to tame her wilder instincts. Driven by sensual photography, trance-like music, and droll humor, Jim Jarmusch’s Only Lovers Left Alive is a meditation on art, science, and the mysteries of everlasting love.\n\nWatch The Trailer →\n\nfrom $0.99 iTunes Movies of the Week http://ift.tt/1yvbcnB\nvia IFTTT"

An ex-Marine haunted by a tragic past, Tommy Riordan returns to his hometown of Pittsburgh and enlists his father, a recovered alcoholic and his former coach, to train him for an MMA tournament awarding the biggest purse in the history of the sport. As Tommy blazes a violent path towards the title prize, his brother, Brendan, a former MMA fighter unable to make ends meet as a public school teacher, returns to the amateur ring to provide for his family. Even though years have passed, recriminations and past betrayals keep Brendan bitterly estranged from both Tommy and his father. But when Brendan’s unlikely rise as an underdog sets him on a collision course with Tommy, the two brothers must finally confront the forces that tore them apart, all the while waging the most intense, winner-takes-all battle of their lives.

"Movies to Watch","Welcome to Me","A mentally unbalanced lottery winner (Kristen Wiig) goes off her medication, buys a talk show and uses it as a platform to broadcast her bizarre opinions on a wide variety of topics."
"Movies to Watch","Houseboat","For several years, Tom Winters (Grant) has been estranged from his wife and their three children, David (Petersen), Elizabeth (Gibson), and Robert (Herbert). The film begins as he returns home from Europe shortly after his wife's death. The children want to stay in the country with their mother's wealthy family, including her parents and her sister Carolyn (Hyer), but Tom takes them to Washington, D.C., where he works in the US State Department.\n\nThe children resent their father, and, at an outdoor concert, Robert runs away. He is found by Cinzia Zaccardi (Loren). She too is running away and is enchanted by little ""Roberto"" and his harmonica. When she brings him back home, Tom offers her a job as a maid, unaware she is the daughter of a famous Italian conductor. She eventually accepts.\n\nCarolyn, now divorced from her husband, offers Tom and the children her old guest house, which was supposed to be moved to a new foundation. However, while the guest house is being towed down the road, it is smashed by an Atlantic Coast Line passenger train after the tow-truck driver, Angelo Donatello (Guardino), flirts with Cinzia and accidentally hits Tom's car. Feeling guilty, Angelo sells Tom his leaky, run-down, old houseboat.\n\nOnce moved in, Tom discovers that Cinzia is unable to cook, do laundry or make coffee. Carolyn and others incorrectly assume that Cinzia's relationship with Tom is sexual while she innocently wins the affection of Tom and the children. Meanwhile, Tom spends his evenings with Carolyn, who is secretly in love with him. On the 4th of July, she tries to embarrass Cinzia by selecting a gaudy dress for Tom to buy for her, but Cinzia transforms it into an elegant evening gown. She looks so beautiful in the gown that Angelo, a confirmed womanizer, cancels a date with her out of a fear of falling in love and proposing to her.\n\n"

Partly spoof and partly homage, it draws heavily on the tropes and themes of American ""Grande Dame Guignol"" films and plays from the 1950s and 1960s that featured strong, sometimes dominating female leads, such as those by Bette Davis (Dead Ringer) and Ethel Merman (Gypsy). It was later performed onstage in 2007 under the same name."

"Movies to Watch","The Great Beauty","From Time Magazines best of culture 2013\n\nGianni Fiorito\nToni Servillo in 'The Great Beauty'\n\nRoma o morte—”Rome or death”—reads the inscription on a statue at the beginning of The Great Beauty, Paolo Sorrentino’s wondrous depiction of high and low society. As seen through the tired but still acute eyes of journalist Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo), Garibaldi’s rallying cry might be changed to “Rome and death,” or possibly “Rome is dead,” for the Eternal City seems near exhaustion, perhaps clinically post-mortem, but still partying defiantly at its own wake.\n\n \nIn his youth Jep wrote an acclaimed novel, The Human Apparatus. Now he is 65, with a fabulous terrace apartment overlooking the Colosseum, and the debauchers who have gathered at his birthday celebration chatter and dance the night away like the guests at a Gatsby revel. Secure in his reputation as “king of the socialites,” Jep is gnawed by unrealized promise. He could not complete his second novel because, he says, “I was looking for the great beauty, and I never found it.”\n\nBeginning with the sudden death of a Japanese tourist and ending with a 103-year-old nun’s arduous climb on her knees up the steps of St. John’s Church, The Great Beauty is gratefully indebted to three films by Federico Fellini: La Dolce Vita, 8½ and Roma. Like the Marcello Mastroianni character in La Dolce Vita, Jep is a fastidious observer and enervated participant in Rome’s night life. Like Mastroianni in that film and 8½, he is bewitched and haunted by the vision of a seraphic young woman, his first love (“Now here’s something I want to show you,” she says before opening her blouse in Jep’s intensest memory.) Sorrentino—who won Cannes’ Jury Prize in 2008 for his Il Divo, also starring the great Servillo—is as preoccupied as Fellini with the way people fight emotional stasis with wild movement. He stuffs, nearly engorges, this 2 hour-and-20-minute film with outrageous and gloriously visual anecdotes.\n\nOne of these offers a clue to Sorrentino’s theme. On the Tebaldi estate, Jep encounters an exhaustive art project: more than 10,000 portraits of a man who was photographed every day of his life, by his father and later by himself, as one person’s record of his promise and growth and—since the man is still in his thirties—a preview of his decline. Jep, who has written about nearly everyone, and slept with them too, finds that he is on that slope to oblivion. As a child, he had loved “the smell of other people’s old houses.” His educated nose can still pick up the scent of grandeur, the rank odor of decay. And now he can smell it in himself.\n\nLike Sorrentino’s corrosive comedy The Family Friend, shown at Cannes in 2006, the new film sees old men as vampires who sustain themselves by supping on the vitality of the young. And like Il Divo, his acid-etched portrait of Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, The Great Beauty mixes journalism and satire. The odd and saving additions: an affection for nearly all of its outsize characters, and a melancholy that the flaming creatures of his acquaintance will soon burn out. Jep’s oldest friend, the aging poet Romano (Carlo Verdone), gets to this point when he asks, ”What’s the matter with nostalgia? It’s the only thing left for those of us who have no faith in the future.”\n\nThe Great Beauty, an essay on nostalgia, gives even the cynics a faith in the vibrancy of movies and the reviving artistry of Paolo Sorrentino. The movie, which was shut out of official prizes at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, will have to make do with our citation: it is the year’s grandest, most exhilarating foreign film.\n\n\n"

He calls the police, who find and arrest five burglars in the Democratic National Committee headquarters within the complex. The next morning, The Washington Post assigns new reporter Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) to the local courthouse to cover the story, which is thought to be of minor importance.\n\nWoodward learns that the five men, four Cuban-Americans from Miami and James W. McCord, Jr., had bugging equipment and have their own ""country club"" attorney. McCord identifies himself in court as having recently left the Central Intelligence Agency and the others also have CIA ties. Woodward connects the burglars to E.

Как заправский психолог он раздает советы слушателям, приправляя их колкими шутками. Пока одна из них не оборачивается против него самого. На вопрос 20-летней Алены, ехать ли ей к отцу, Роман отвечает «Конечно! Я был бы рад». Он не знает, что в эфире — плод его случайной связи, а он сам в одночасье стал не только отцом, но и дедушкой Алениного сына. Новоиспеченные родственники погружают в ад беззаботного Романа и его девушку Сашу, светскую львицу и владелицу радиостанции. Не меньшее разочарование ждет и Алену.

"Movies to Watch","Monsters University (2013) ★★★★☆","https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/monsters-university/id668260266\n\nMonsters University is a 2013 American 3D computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures.[6] It was directed by Dan Scanlon and produced by Kori Rae, with John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich as executive producers. It is the fourteenth feature film produced by Pixar and is a prequel to 2001’s Monsters, Inc., marking the first time Pixar has made a prequel film.[7]\n\nDisney, as the rights holder, had plans for a second Monsters, Inc. film since 2005. Following disagreements with Pixar, Disney tasked its Circle 7 Animation unit to make the sequel.[8] An early draft of the film was developed; however, Disney’s purchase of Pixar in early 2006 led to the cancellation of Circle 7’s version of the film.[9] A Pixar-made sequel was confirmed in 2010,[6] and in 2011, it was confirmed that the film would instead be a prequel titled Monsters University.[10]\n\nMonsters University tells the story of two monsters, Mike and Sulley, and their time studying at college, where they start off as rivals, but slowly become best friends. Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Bob Peterson, and John Ratzenberger reprise their roles as Mike Wazowski, James P. Sullivan, Randall Boggs, Roz, and the Abominable Snowman, respectively. Bonnie Hunt, who played Ms. Flint in the first film, voices Mike’s grade school teacher Ms. Karen Graves. The music for the film is composed by Randy Newman, marking his seventh collaboration with Pixar.\n\nMonsters University premiered on June 5, 2013 at the BFI Southbank in London, United Kingdom and was released on June 21, 2013, in the United States. It was accompanied in theaters by a short film, The Blue Umbrella, directed by Saschka Unseld.[11] The film received positive reviews and was a box office success, grossing $743 million against its estimated budget of $200 million.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsters_University"

In the midst of a divorce from his estranged wife, Emma (Carla Gugino), he calls his daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) to discuss their upcoming trip to San Francisco. Meanwhile, Caltech seismologist Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti) and his colleague Dr. Kim Park (Will Yun Lee) are at the Hoover Dam making a breakthrough in earthquake prediction when an unknown fault nearby ruptures, triggering a magnitude 7.1 earthquake that collapses the dam and kills Park in the process when he stays on the dam to save a little girl. When Ray is called into work, Blake reluctantly decides to go with her mother Emma's new boyfriend, Daniel Riddick (Ioan Gruffudd), a wealthy real estate developer, to San Francisco where he is completing a downtown high-rise building.\n\nHayes discovers that the San Andreas Fault is starting to shift, causing a massive 9.1 earthquake that starts ripping apart major cities along the fault line. At the same time, Emma is having lunch with Daniel's sister Susan (Kylie Minogue) when the quake hits Los Angeles, destroying much of the city with Susan among its heavy casualties. Ray is able to save Emma, and they barely escape the city onboard his helicopter. Much of Southern California becomes affected by the quake. In San Francisco, Daniel brings Blake to his office building. Blake waits for Daniel in the lobby, where she meets Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt), an engineering student from the United Kingdom seeking employment at the office, and his little brother, Ollie (Art Parkinson). Daniel returns and attempts to leave the office with Blake, but the two become trapped in their car in the parking garage of the building after the string of earthquakes begin to strike the city, partially collapsing the garage. Daniel leaves the car in search of help, but flees in terror, leaving Blake behind. She is found by Ben and Ollie, who help free her from the car and escape the collapsing building. The trio find a working phone line and Blake calls Ray, who begins to fly toward San Francisco with Emma to save her.\n\nWhile enroute, the engine in Ray's helicopter suddenly fails, forcing him to make an emergency crash-landing into a mall below them in Bakersfield, where massive looting is taking place. Among the chaos, Ray steals a Ford F-150 from the parking lot, and the couple resumes their journey on the road, but find they are trapped by the expanding fault line. The couple comes across an older couple broken down on the side of the road. They find out that the older couple own an aeroplane. The older couple agrees to give them the keys to the plane in exchange for their vehicle. Before starting the engine, Ray doubts that he'd be able to save Blake, remembering when he failed to save his other daughter, Malorie, from drowning in a drifting accident. But he is encouraged by Emma to save their only living child, and the couple take off to find her.\n\nMeanwhile, Blake, Ben and Ollie try to find a spot in the city where Ray and Emma can save them; seeing that their planned rendezvous point, Coit Tower, is already engulfed by flames. With help from news reporter Serena (Archie Panjabi), Hayes is able to warn others of a much bigger earthquake in San Francisco, just in time before it hits; becoming the largest earthquake ever in history, recorded as a 9.6.\n\nRay and Emma eventually arrive in San Francisco, abandoning their aircraft and parachuting into AT&T Park just as the aftershocks continue to destroy the city. They commandeer a boat and hear a warning over the radio that a tsunami is approaching the city. Along with other evacuees with boats of their own, they are able to get over the incoming wave near the Golden Gate Bridge. Daniel, who is on the bridge, is killed when a cargo ship slices the bridge in half and a loose shipping container crushes him. The tsunami floods the city, causing massive casualties and knocking over several buildings. Blake, Ben, and Ollie manage to run into Daniel's building moments before the water hits. They move up floors and manage to signal Ray and Emma, who are searching nearby for Blake. As they see the trio, the building starts sinking into the ground, causing water to flood the building. Ben and Ollie are able to escape, but Blake becomes trapped in the rising water, runs out of air, and, losing hope, nearly drowns herself before Ray can get to her. Emma crashes the boat through the building's thick window panes in an attempt to get everyone on board before escaping as the building completely collapses. Now aboard the small boat, Ray performs CPR on Blake and finally revives her after several minutes.\n\nThe five make it to a relief camp in Marin County. The now reconciled Ray and Emma, along with Blake, Ben, and Ollie, talk about their future as the sun slowly sets on the now destroyed Bay Area, now swarmed with different military organizations and rescue vehicles initiating the relief process. The camera pans out, revealing the quake has changed the geography of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n"

"Movies to Watch","The Place Beyond the Pines","If audiences came for two of People magazine's Sexiest Men, they stayed for a layered parable of crime, families and the responsibilities of fatherhood. Presumably to protect our eyes, Baby Goose and B-Coops share only a few brief scenes in the film that lurches unexpectedly from crime thriller to something more, well, profound at its midway point. If that makes it sound like 2013's answer to Heat, the comparison isn't too far off the mark. Cooper and DeHaan, calculating politico and vengeful youngster respectively, show how bad decisions can reverberate through the years. We knew Blue Valentine's Derek Cianfrance could nail the intimate moments, but this ambitious tale with overtones of Greek tragedy proved that a bigger canvas held no fears for him either."

It stars Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, Danny Huston, and Benicio del Toro.\nLike Arriaga's and González Iñárritu's previous film, Amores perros (2000), 21 Grams interweaves several plot lines, around the consequences of a tragic automobile accident. Penn plays a critically ill academic mathematician, Watts plays a grief-stricken mother, and del Toro plays a born-again Christian ex-convict whose faith is sorely tested in the aftermath of the accident.\n21 Grams is presented in a non-linear arrangement where the lives of the characters are depicted before and after the accident. The three main characters each have 'past', 'present', and 'future' story threads, which are shown as non-linear fragments that punctuate elements of the overall story, all imminently coming toward each other and coalescing as the story progresses.\n\nContents\n [hide] 1 Title\n2 Plot\n3 Cast\n4 Rec... \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Grams"

"Movies to Watch","Blow Out - 1981 - 107 Minutes - Drama","Director: Brian De Palma\nWriter: Brian De Palma\n\n107 Minutes\n\nThis stylish Brian De Palma thriller plays off the theme of the unsuspecting witness who discovers a crime and is thereby put in grave danger, but with a novel twist. Jack Terry is a master sound recordist who works on grade-B horror movies. Late one evening, he is recording sounds for use in his movies when he hears something unexpected through his sound equipment and records it. Curiosity gets the better of him when the media become involved, and he begins to unravel the pieces of a nefarious conspiracy. As he struggles to survive against his shadowy enemies and expose the truth, he does not know whom he can trust."

Aunque el nombre es del italiano, la pronunciación cuando se refiere al Estudio es 'ji-bri' o 'ji-bu-ri', para adaptarse a la fonética japonesa.

Moving from city to country and back again, I AM CUBA examines the various problems caused by political oppression as well as by great discrepancies in wealth and power. Beginning in Havana in the pre-Castro era, we see how foreigners contributed to the city's prostitution and poverty; this sequence features dreamy, hallucinogenic camera work that creates a feeling of unease and dislocation. Then, in glorious images of palm tress and fertile land, the film looks at the sugar cane fields in the countryside, and the difficulties faced by peasants working the land. Finally, back in the city again, leftist students battle the police and a corrupt government—and pay a high price for their rebellion."

Hoping to hold onto him, she refuses to divulge the name of his real birth mother. The revelation shakes Yuddy to his very core, unleashing a cascade of conflicting emotions. Two women have the bad luck to fall for Yuddy. One is a quiet lass named Su Lizhen who works at a sports arena, while the other is a glitzy showgirl named Mimi. Perhaps due to his unresolved Oedipal issues, he passively lets the two compete for him, unable or unwilling to make a choice. As Lizhen slowly confides her frustration to a cop named Tide, he falls for her. The same is true for Yuddy's friend Zeb, who falls for Mimi. Later, Yuddy learns of his birth mother's whereabouts and heads out to the Philippines"

"Movies to Watch","Draga Ivana, dragi fajans time,","Molim vas za malu edukaciju. Jutros, 4.VIII u 7:30AM PST, u Sijetlu, po ko zna koji put doživeo sam neprijatnost pokušavajući da platim hotelski račun nakon boravka na TechReady. Naravno, kartica se kao i obično baunsovala, pa sam morao da zovem kol centar da razjasnim. Nakon višeminutnog razgovora sa ljubaznim službenikom Banca Intese (mislim da je u pitanju bio Marko, ali je veza bila jako loša pa nisam sto posto siguran) objašnjeno mi je da je limit plaćanja na mojoj kartici 500EUR (???!!!???), tako da ne postoji način (!!!!!!!) da njom platim hotelski račun od skoro 2000USD. Na moju sreću, pošto mi se ovakve neprijatnosti redovno dešavaju na putovanjima u USA (ovo je sigurno 5-ti put, u 10 godina koliko putujem u US), na privatnom računu imao sam sredstva kojima sam platio boravak. Od vas mi je potrebna sledeća pouka:\n1) šta da uradimo da ovakve situacije konačno prestanu?\n1a) kao potpitanje: kako je i da li je uopšte moguće da je limit na službenoj master kartici samo 500EUR, naročito u vreme kad su uobičajeni putevi u US? Siguran sam da je limit bio veći, pa me zanima da li je limit smanjen, a da sam ja propustio  anaunsment dok sam bio na odsustvu, ili je u pitanju neka greška\n2) hotelski račun od 2000USD sam platio privatnom visa karticom u 2 transakcije (500USD pa ostatak), što je rezultovalo skidanjem eur sa  mog privatnog računa u iznosu od 461.56EUR pa 1377.05EUR plus provizija banke na devizne transakcije. Koji je pravilan način da se ta sredstva refundiraju, odnosno kako je potrebno da popunim expense report (i kakva potvrda od banke je potrebna kao prilog da bi se reflektovale konverzije valute i provizija skinuta prilikom naplate)?\n\nHvala unapred,\nKića\n "

Pink? Well, what’s wrong with pink?\nSeems you’ve got a pink kink in your think.\nDoes it matter what color? Well, that gets nope.\nBe it pink purple or heliotrope.\nNow sometimes you’re up and sometimes you’re down,\nWhen you find that you’re down well just look around:\nYou still got a body, good legs and fine feet,\nGet your head in the right place and hey, you’re complete!\n\n“Now as for the dancin’, you can do more,\nYou can reach great heights, in fact you can soar.\nYou just get a leg up and ya slap it on down,\nAnd you’ll find you’re up in what’s called a bound.\nBound, bound, and rebound.\nBound and you’re up right next to the sky,\nAnd I think you can do it if you give it a try,\nFirst get a leg up, slap it on down…”\n\nSo every year, along about May,\nThey’d load him up and they’d haul him away,\nAnd they’d shave him and dump him all naked and bare.\nHe learned to live with it, he didn’t care,\nHe’d just bound, bound, bound, and rebound.\n\nNow in this world of ups and downs…\nSo nice to know there are jackalopes around."

They meet when Emmi ducks inside a bar, driven by the rain and drawn by the exotic Arabic music (Al Asfouryeh by Sabah) she says she has heard so often on her walk home from work. A woman in the bar (Katharina Herberg) who is part of Ali's Arabic-speaking cohort tauntingly suggests Ali ask Emmi (""the old woman"") to dance, and Emmi accepts. A strange and unlikely friendship develops, then a romance and soon they are living together in Emmi's flat. Out of a professed sense of responsibility but also hopefulness, Emmi first confides in her newfound love when she goes to visit her daughter Krista (Irm Hermann) and her tyrannical son-in-law Eugen (Fassbinder himself) and announces that she is in love with Ali; Eugen thinks she is screwy and Krista as well can only think that her mother - who has been a widow for years - is fantasizing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsLlXnmxWtM"

Persuaded by Tom, the town agree to hide Grace, and in return she freely helps the locals. However, when the Sheriff from a neighbouring town posts a Missing notice, advertising a reward for revealing her whereabouts, the townsfolk require a better deal from Grace, in return for their silence; and when the Sheriff returns some weeks later with a Wanted poster, even though the citizens know her to be innocent of the false charges against her, the town's sense of goodness takes a sinister turn and the price of Grace's freedom becomes a workload and treatment akin to that of a slave. But Grace has a deadly secret that the townsfolk will eventually encounter. \n\n"

But the film’s real glory is its emotional immediacy. Following its main character, Adele (Ms. Exarchopoulos) from adolescence into adulthood, the director, Abdellatif Kechiche, tracks the awakening of her consciousness with exquisite empathy. He also, perhaps more remarkably, grounds her emerging sexuality within a precisely rendered tableau of contemporary France, where traditional republican ideals coexist with multicultural realities.

But also take note of Vallée, who expands on the themes and style he used to lesser effect in last year's overrated ""Dallas Buyers Club."" (If Vallée truly is the next Hal Ashby, ""Wild"" is a strong reason why.) ""Wild"" hits all the right notes, and in a year of bombastic biopics -- ""Unbroken,"" ""The Theory of Everything"" -- stands out because of its nuance, subtlety and humanity.

The two sequences ""meet"" at the end of the film, producing one common story.[2] It stars Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby, a man with anterograde amnesia, which impairs his ability to store new explicit memories, who has developed a system for recollection using hand-written notes, tattoos, and Polaroid photos. During the opening credits, which portray the end of the story, it is shown that Leonard kills Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). The film suggests that this killing is vengeance for the rape and murder of his wife (Jorja Fox) based on information provided by Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss).\nMemento premiered on September 5, 2000, at the Venice Intern... \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)"

Het bedrijf met een streng-christelijke achtergrond was van ongeveer 1985 tot 2000 gevestigd in Barneveld op de Veluwe. Nadat een notering op de Amerikaanse beurs was aangevraagd, bleek dat allerlei financiële zaken niet goed geregeld waren; het aanvankelijk succes was op drijfzand gebaseerd. Het bedrijf werd van een faillissement gered toen het werd opgekocht door een Engels bedrijf.\nRegisseur Theu Boermans vertelt het verhaal (idee van Kees Prins en scenarist Frank Ketelaar) van de streng gereformeerde broers Johan en Peter van der Laan, gespeeld door Kees Prins en Pierre Bokma.

His volatile editor, Lotterman, assigns him to tourist pieces and horoscopes, but promises more. Paul rooms with Sala, an ageing and equally alcoholic reporter, in a rundown flat.

"Movies to Watch","Never Let Me Go","看了电影《Never Let Me Go》。没看过英国作家石黒一雄的那本同名小说。\n \n电影的开始像是一部要讲述将来的科幻片，字幕说：医学技术发生突破，人类得以长生不老。下面的情节发生在一所英国的寄宿学校，人物是几个中学年纪的小孩儿，跟所有青春题材的故事一样，无非是上课、打架、忠诚与背叛、成长的烦恼。这么说吧，就跟《阳光灿烂的日子》或者《哈利波特》里的学校没什么大差别。可是这一切的背后总让人觉得有那么点儿不对劲。\n \n然后观众和剧中人同时发现了真相。他们属于一个特殊的群体，捐献器官是这群人在那个世界存在的全部目的，生活在他们周围的“其他人”会因为这些器官而得到医治，而他们的生命将要在年轻的时候因完成全部捐献任务而结束。看到这儿，按好莱坞常见的套路有两种往下发展的可能。一种是走道德伦理片的路子，探讨一下科技与人类、克隆与道义，煽情点儿可以弄成《人工智能》，要想深刻就讲一个《１９８４》那样的政治寓言。另一种可能是干脆拍成惊险片，讴歌美国观众喜爱的主旋律：自由、正义、反抗、胜利，英雄救美、以弱胜强、旧的不去、新的不来，打他个天昏地暗凯而慷、人间正道咣咣咣！\n \n《Never Let Me Go》却出乎意料地说了别的。整个故事与抗争毫无关系，影片中的“我们”从始至终平静地接受了自己在世界中的位置，该吃饭吃饭，该睡觉睡觉，该工作工作，一切普通得几乎就像我们的生活。然而就是在这种贯穿两个小时的平静之中，每一个观众却被迫在无比真实地面对一个令人压抑的事实。\n \n这是一部关于生与死的电影。\n \n猛一想你也许会觉得你我的处境更像是电影里的“其他人”，你是一个会计你是一个记者或者你是一个工程师你最近买了一个房子。可是看下去你会不安地发现，也许我们更像电影里的“我们”，我们也经历过同样的成长、恋爱、分手、重逢，同样有朋友、有回忆、有盼望、有失望；我们同样地会羡慕这个世界上的“其他人”——我想跟 Michael Bloomberg 一样在上东区有一所豪宅，你想当李开复有折腾不完的钱和遍地都是的粉丝——虽然我们都知道这绝不可能发生；我们同样地会在将来的某一天死去，我们也正同样地在等待中生活。\n \n当你不得不面对加速来到的死亡的时候，一切平时熟悉、平淡的东西就都变得鲜艳起来。\n \n故事中的将来发生在我们的过去，生命随着时间一晃而过，七十年代，八十年代，九十年代，画面里的房子、街道、衣服、汽车越来越眼熟，就像看到了一个平行的宇宙。"

Is it still possible to influence the course of events in this world? These are the questions posed by the great Chilean filmmaker Carmen Castillo (her Calle Santa Fe was a selection of the 2007 NYFF) in this new documentary essay. Castillo, herself a one-time MIR militant expelled from Chile by the Pinochet regime, structures her film in dialogue with the writings of her late friend Daniel Bensaïd, organizer of the Paris student revolts in May ’68 and France’s leading Trotskyite philosopher. In Europe and Latin America, Castillo finds the ones who have resisted, from the masked Zapatistas of Chiapas in Mexico to the Water Warriors of Cochabamba in Bolivia, from the Landless Workers movement in Brazil to the striking workers at the Donges refinery in western France to the homeless squatters of Marseille. A mournful premise lays the groundwork for a radiantly hopeful film.

The government’s intervention is making life more difficult on his remote community, what with the proper policing of whitefella laws that don’t generally make much sense, and Charlie’s kin seeming more interested in going along with things than doing anything about it. So Charlie takes off, to live the old way, but in doing so sets off a chain of events in his life that has him return to his community chastened, and somewhat the wiser.. \n"

"Movies to Watch","Tips untuk org lapar","Sering Lapar? Kendalikan\ndengan Cara Ini !\nWELCOME TO MY TREAD\nSpoiler for No repost\nHalo gan selamat datang di tread\nane yang pertamax ini hehe\nDi Thread ane yang pertama ini\nane mau bahas tentang gimana\nsupaya kita bisa ngontrol/\nngendaliin rasa lapar\nkita ,soalnya rasa lapar yang tak\nterkontrol itu merupakan salah\nsatu penyebab utama\nbertambahnya berat badan kita\ngan.Jadi buat agan2 yang lagi/\npengen diet wajib baca ini deh\nhaha .\nKalo gitu langsung ane mulai aje\ndeh gan hehe\nQuote:\nLasa lapar yang tak terkontrol\nmerupakan salah satu\npenyebab utama bertambahnya\nberat badan. Jika rasa lapar\ntidak dituruti, terkadang tubuh\nakan terasa lemas atau tak\nbertenaga. Padahal untuk\nmendapat massa tubuh ideal,\nasupan makanan harus terjaga.\nPara pelaku diet pemula\nbiasanya kerap menghadapi\nkendala itu. Saat rasa ngidam\nsemakin kuat, mengontrol rasa\nlapar sangat sulit dilakukan.\nAkibatnya makanan yang\nseharusnya tak disentuh justru\nludes seketika.\nSaat berdiet, wajib hukumnya\nuntuk mengendalikan rasa\nlapar. Namun, mengendalikan\nrasa lapar bukan berarti tidak\nmakan sama sekali lho.\nPasalnya diet ketat merupakan\nide buruk yang dapat\nmenyebabkan berbagai\ngangguan kesehatan.\nBagaimana cara mengendalikan\nrasa lapar dengan benar? Inilah\nbeberapa langkah mudah untuk\nmengendalikan rasa lapar :\nSpoiler for Pertama\n1. Minum Air\nMinumlah segelas air putih 10\nmenit sebelum makan sesuatu.\nDengan cara itu, perut akan\nterasa lebih terisi dan rasa\nlapar dapat dikontrol. Jumlah\nmakanan yang diraup pun akan\ntetap terkendali.\nSpoiler for Kedua\n2. Makan keju cottage\nKeju cottage ,keju yg mirip\nseperti tahu ini mengandung\nkasein yang dapat menekan\nrasa lapar. Selain itu, keju\ncottage merupakan keju rendah\nlemak yang sehat, cocok untuk\nmereka yang ingin menurunkan\nberat badan.\nSpoiler for Ketiga\n3. Meraup Yoghurt Yunani\nTekstur yang kental sekaligus\nlembut membuat yoghurt jenis\nini dapat mengeyangkan perut\nlebih lama. Produk olahan susu\nini kaya akan protein dan\ndianggap sebagai makanan\npengekang rasa lapar yang\ncocok untuk diet\nSpoiler for Keempat\n4. Menyantap sup\nDiet sup cukup populer sebagai\nsalah satu cara untuk\nmenurunkan berat badan. Tapi,\nbukan sembarang sup yang\nboleh dikonsumsi. Pilihlah sup\nsayuran atau sup herbal untuk\nmengendalikan rasa lapar.\nSpoiler for Kelima\n5. Menyeruput teh\nMinumlah beberapa teguk teh\nherbal ketika sedang ingin\nmenyantap sesuatu. Teh\nmerupakan penekan nafsu\nmakan sekaligus pengontrol\nrasa lapar karena menimbulkan\nsensai ""penuh"" pada perut.\nSpoiler for Keenam\n6. Bawang\nRempah yang sehat ini dapat\nmenekan rasa lapar dengan\nmengirimkan sinyal kenyang ke\notak. Dengan meraup bumbu\ndapur yang populer ini, Anda\nakan merasa lebih kenyang dan\nsekaligus membakar sejumlah\nkalori.\nSpoiler for Ketujuh\n7. Menambahkan cabai\nCabai adalah salah satu bumbu\nmenyehatkan yang dapat\nmengontrol rasa lapar dengan\nmenimbulkan sensasi penuh\natau kenyang. Terlebih lagi,\ncabai merupakan bumbu dapur\nyang dapat membakar lemak. Si\nmerah dengan rasa menggigit\nlidah ini juga kaya akan vitamin\nA, vitamin C, dan betakaroten\nyang dapat membantu\npencernaan dan mengontrol\nrasa lapar.\nSpoiler for Kedelapan\n8. Mengendalikan diri\nMengendalikan hasrat adalah\nsalah satu cara alami paling\npenting untuk mengontrol rasa\nlapar yang bercokol. Dengan\nmelakukan pengendalian diri,\nAnda juga akan merasa lebih\npercaya diri. Untuk itu, cobalah\nkontrol rasa lapar Anda dengan\nmemfokuskan pikiran.\nSpoiler for Kesembilan\n9. Patahkan aturan makan tiga\nkali sehari\nKebanyakan orang makan\nbesar sebanyak tiga kali sehari\ndan menyisakan banyak waktu\nluang dengan merasa lapar.\nSebenarnya, aturan makan tiga\nkali sehari tidak harus diikuti.\nCerdaslah dengan makan\ndalam jumlah sedikit pada\nwaktu yang tepat. Dengan\ndemikian, rasa lapar tidak akan\nsering menghantui.\nSpoiler for Terakhir\n10. Meminum lassi\nLassi adalah minuman yoghurt\ndingin yang berasal dari\nkawasan Pakistan dan India.\nCara membuatnya, yoghurt\ndiblender bersama air, garam,\nmerica, es, dan rempah-rempah\ndaerah setempat. Lassi memiliki\nrasa yang nikmat dan dapat\nmengontrol rasa lapar dalam\nwaktu lama.\nMinumlah segelas lassi 30 menit\nsebelum makan untuk\nmengontrol selera sekaligus\njumlah makanan yang disantap.\nPastikan yoghurt yang dipilih\nrendah lemak, bukan yoghurt\ncreamy tinggi lemak."

Адаптация.\n\n«Адаптация.» (англ. Adaptation.) — эксцентрическая трагикомедия режиссёра Спайка Джонза, снятая по сценарию Чарли Кауфмана. Фильм основан на книге Сьюзан Орлеан «Вор орхидей» и самореференции сценариста. В фильме снимались: Николас Кейдж в ролях Чарли и Дональда, Мерил Стрип в роли Сьюзан и Крис Купер в роли Джона Лароша.\nРабота над фильмом началась ещё в 1994 году. Продюсер Джонатан Демми работал над проектом для Columbia Pictures, сценарий для которого должен был написать Кауфман. Кауфман испытывал творческий кризис и не смог справиться с задачей. Однако он написал сценарий о самом процессе адаптации сценария для «Вора орхидей». Режиссёром нового проекта стал Спайк Джонз. Съемки закончились в июне 2001 года.

"Movies to Watch","4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days (Cristian Mungiu 2007)","4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days is a Romanian film, written and directed by Cristian Mungiu, which features two restrained yet very powerful performances from its two female leads, Anamaria Marinca and Laura Vasiliu.\n\nSet in 1980’s Romania at the end of Communist rule, this film follows two friends as they arrange an illegal abortion for one of them.\n\nStark, clinical and with a certain almost documentary-like feel to it, 4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days is a harrowing and intense experience as we primarily follow one of the friends make all the preparations for the other by securing a hotel room and bribes whilst also arranging the so-called doctor to perform the procedure. The third act of the movie consists of the horrible circumstances surrounding the illegal abortion in a dingy hotel room.\n\n4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days won both the Palme d’Or and the FIPRESCI (Film Critics) Prize at Cannes in 2007 as well as a string other international awards at various festivals and award ceremonies, mostly for its director and two lead actresses.\n\n"

"Movies to Watch","The theory of everything","this is the extraordinary story of one of the world's greatest living minds, the renowned astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, who falls deeply in love with fellow Cambridge student Jane Wilde. Once a healthy, active young man, Hawking received an earth-shattering diagnosis at 21 years of age. With Jane fighting tirelessly by his side, Stephen embarks on his most ambitious scientific work, studying the very thing he now has precious little of - time. Together, they defy impossible odds, breaking new ground in medicine and science, and achieving more than they could ever have dreamed. The film is based on the memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen, by Jane Hawking, and is directed by Academy Award winner James Marsh (""Man on Wire""). (c) Focus"

Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss' young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart, Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives."

As Father James, a priest who received his calling late in life after the death of his wife, Gleeson’s wisdom and solidity is balanced out by wry, salty years of secular experience. His indisputable goodness exists in a realm of abuse, despair, infidelity, anger, and vice for which he can only give his counsel. Over the course of a week, he deals with his daughter’s (Kelly Reilly) recent suicide attempt, his parishioners’ individual miseries, and the man who’s vowed to kill him as retaliation for childhood molestation at the hands of another priest. Calvary sketches out a world in which pain is unavoidable, but forgiveness is divine."

I’m Melvin Brooks. I’ve come to stop the show.”\nSo begins “Mel Brooks Live at the Geffen,” a new one-man HBO comedy special from the madcap mind behind classic films such as “Blazing Saddles,” “Young Frankenstein,” and “The Producers.”\n\nDuring the show, Brooks keeps the audience rolling with one well-crafted joke after another. It’s easy to see why the special ignited a bidding war when it came up for sale.\n“CAA did a screening… It got down to Netflix, who wouldn’t give up, and to HBO. And since I had done two shows with HBO, I told CAA ‘I think I owe HBO a modicum of loyalty.'”\nOn stage, Brooks also wastes no time launching into stories of his days as a stand-up comedian and “row boat wrangler” in New York’s Catskill Mountains. He recounts how he first fell in love with show business as a child growing up in Brooklyn and recalls how he got his big break as a writer for Sid Caesar on “Your Show of Shows.”\nBrooks’ previous HBO specials, “Mel Brooks Strikes Back” and “Mel Brooks and Dick Cavett Together Again,” aired in 2012 and 2011 respectively. Brooks also said that he did about an hour and a half of material that was then edited down to an hour. One story that did not make the final cut was a true bone-tickler about “The Godfather” author Mario Puzo.\n“I just had an urge. I wondered ‘Could I go back to the Catskills? Could I go out there just me and a mic and entertain a thousand people?,'” Brooks told TheWrap in an interview on Thursday\n\n"

"Movies to Watch","Social theory tutorial","The strength of weak ties\nGranovetter's paper ""The Strength of Weak Ties"" is a highly influential research, with about 30,000 citations according to Google Scholar (by October 2014). In 1969 Granovetter submitted it to American Sociological Review, but it was rejected. One of the reviewers stated: “…it should not be published. I respectfully submit the following among an endless series of reasons that immediately came to mind”; the other added: “… I find that his scholarship is somewhat elementary.. [he] has confined himself to a few older and obvious items”.[4] Eventually this pioneering research was published in 1973 in American Journal of Sociology and became the most cited work in the Social Sciences. In marketing, information science, or politics, weak ties enable reaching populations and audiences that are not accessible via strong ties. The concepts and findings of this work were later published in the monograph Getting A Job, an adaptation of Granovetter's doctoral dissertation at Harvard University's Department of Social Relations, with the title: ""Changing Jobs: Channels of Mobility Information in a Suburban Population"" (313 pages\n\n). In 1970 Dr. Granovetter submitted his doctoral dissertation to Harvard University, entitled ""Changing Jobs: Channels of Mobility Information in a Suburban Community."" The thesis of his dissertation illustrated the conception of weak ties. For his research, Dr. Granovetter crossed the Charles River to Newton, Massachusetts where he surveyed 282 professional, technical, and managerial workers in total. 100 were personally interviewed, in regards to the type of ties between the job changer and the contact person who provided the necessary information. Tie strength was measured in terms of how often they saw the contact person during the period of the job transition, using the following assignment:\n\noften = at least once a week\noccasionally = more than once a year but less than twice a week\nrarely = once a year or less\nOf those who found jobs through personal contacts (N=54), 16.7% reported seeing their contact often, 55.6% reported seeing their contact occasionally, and 27.8% rarely.[8] When asked whether a friend had told them about their current job, the most frequent answer was “not a friend, an acquaintance.” The conclusion from this study is that weak ties are an important resource in occupational mobility. When seen from a macro point of view, weak ties play a role in affecting social cohesion.\n\nMotivation for Granovetter’s Theory\n\nCareers, job changing. Why is it that people so often get jobs from weak ties?\nHow do large groups coordinate to make things happen, for example to meet a threat from outside\nSince then it has developed into a larger perspective known as embeddedness, which holds that all economic action, including that by organizations, is enabled and constrained and shaped by social ties among individuals\n \n\nOverview of the Theory\n\nhttp://www.analytictech.com/networks/weakties.htm read \n\nSummary:\n\nThe strength of weak ties is a seminal paper in the study of social networks and a hugely famous paper in sociology more generally. The paper raises the argument that the study of social networks can be a tool for studying sociology more generally, raises a hypothesis about the usefulness of certain types (i.e., weak) ties in certain situations, and uses empirical data from a study on job search to show the value of weak ties in this case.\n\nGranovetter defines a tie (and its strength) as, ""a combination of the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy (mutual confiding), and the reciprocal services which characterize the tie."" The paper suggests that there is a ""forbidden triad"" which says that if AB and connected, and A and C are connected, B and C will also be connected. This is particularly the case if the ties are strong between two people.\n\nGranovetter argues that some ties can act as a ""bridge"" (referencing a brokerage positions) that spans parts of a social network and connected otherwise disconnected social groups but argues strongly that ""no strong tie is a bridge."" The argument is that if someone is strong tied to someone else, those around their tie will also be tied to them and ties will be redundant. Granovetter argues that for diffusion across a network, is the weak ties that are most valuable. He argues that diffusion studies tend to not be sociometric and those that are do not characterize the tie type.\n\nGranovetter used empirical evidence from a survey of job seekers. He asked people who had found a job through contacts how often they saw the person that had helped them with their job. 56% saw their contacts only occasionally and 28% saw them rarely skewing strongly toward the ""weak"" end of the spectrum. Nearly half of these job contacts were made with only one network hop implying a very close network.\n\nAnother important, but less emphasized, aspects of Granovetter's work is the strong emphasis on linking macro and micro theories. Weak ties, Granovetter argues, are more likely to link different groups together and so can provide a way of connecting the literatures on small groups or families with more macro discussions of social structure. The paper argues that personal experience is largely connected up with large-scale aspects of social structurally.\n\nTheoretical and practical relevance:\n\nGranovetter's article is one of the most influential articles in all of social science has been cited more than 20,000 times. It is perhaps the seminar article in contemporary social network analysis.\n\nQ3 ••\n\nThe people we associate with can have a powerful effect on our behavior—for better or for worse. This holds true for human health and body mass, too. The heavier our close friends and family, the heavier we are likely to be. \n\nThis correlation, described in 2007 by a team that analyzed data from the longitudinal Framingham Heart Study, is well established. But just how this transpires—whether via shared norms, common behavior or just similar environments—has been the subject of much debate. \n\nThe authors of the 2007 study proposed that social norms shared among friends and relatives might be a strong determinant of body mass index (BMI). And a new study, published online May 5 in the American Journal of Public Health, drills down to see just how these social forces might be at work. The study of more than 100 women—and hundreds of their friends and family members—however, suggests that social attitudes might not be key in determining obesity clusters after all. \n\n""Going in as anthropologists we assumed that the norms would have a strong influence"" on BMI, says Alexandra Brewis, executive director of the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State University in Tempe. She and her colleagues found themselves surprised how small an effect the norms had on a person's BMI. Just one type of social dynamic seemed to play a statistically significant role—and that was only about 20 percent.\n\nBut a small effect is not no effect, points out James Fowler, a professor at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine and Division of Social Sciences, and co-author of the 2007 The New England Journal of Medicine paper that described the influence of social ties on obesity rates. The finding that even 20 percent of weight status can be attributed to social norms suggests that ""at least some of what is spreading are ideas about body size."" And that, he says, is ""incredibly exciting,"" as it hints at some methods to start stemming the social spread of obesity. \n\nThe influence of friends\nTo try to better understand the ways in which social norms might be influencing social clusters of obesity, Brewis and her colleagues interviewed 101 Arizona women aged 18 to 45—and 812 of their close social ties, including friends, spouses, family members, coworkers and others—about their attitudes toward body size. All subjects were questioned about their ideal size, their preference for being non-obese (relative to other conditions, such as being an alcoholic or blind), and how much stigma they associated with a person's being overweight or obese.  \n\nThe subjects' answers correlated with their BMI (by design, half of the women were overweight or obese) and with the BMI and answers given by their social ties. Brewis and her team then tested the data against a framework of three possible pathways that might help explain why people and those they are close to have similar body sizes. The frameworks held up in the analysis: The first describes the case in which social norms between people converge ""and that makes you both behave the same way,"" Brewis explains; the second, occurs when two people might have different social norms, but a friend's social norms ""shape [the other's] behavior even if they don't internalize them""; and the third possibility—""it's not really due to the relationship at all,"" but rather something else that is related to body size, such as simply frequently seeing friends who are overweight. \n\nGiven the way the study was designed, however, it is quite possible that the effect of social norms is ""even higher"" than 20 percent, Fowler says. \n\nThe findings are by no means the final word on the influence of social norms, says Ross Hammond, director of the Center on Social Dynamics and Policy at The Brookings Institution. ""It examines one kind of norm,"" he says. ""I think this study is a good start,"" but, he notes, ""even for these kinds of norms, there are other pathways through which this might matter."" He also notes that although the study focused on a certain age range of women, it did not pull out differences that might be at work in subsets of age, BMI or demographics. ""Some of the results they find may mask quite strong effects in subgroups,"" he says. Brewis says that her group hopes to start studying the role of social norms in different countries as well, such as in India and Paraguay. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09"
