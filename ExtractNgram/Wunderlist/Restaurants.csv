Bottega is always a good fallback option and I hear the newish Redbird is quite good.\n\nIt's actually a Facebook group I follow where people post dtla info.

"Restaurants","Burgers","Adibs list Aug 2015\n\nDip and Flip - The Dip and Flip burger - Heaven in a bun. Amazing beef burger, topped with layers of sliced roast beef and cheese…all drenched in gravy. I want one right now.\nHonest Burgers - The Honest - Old reliable and the best value for money. The rosemary salted chips are just so good!\nBleecker St Burger - Cheeseburger - There's just something about the beef patties, so delicious and full of flavour.\nBukowski Grill - The Purist - Nostalgic favourite, I need a repeat visit though. Special note - The beef ribs are INCREDIBLE.\nBoom Burger - The Boom Burger - Love the flavours on this one!\nBusan BBQ - Bulgogi Burger - Burger + Korean BBQ = genius.\nPatty and Bun - The Ari Gold - Single handedly converted me to the joys of medium-rare.\nPsychic Burger - The Psychic - Just a lovely burger with great sauce.\nMother Flipper - The Mother Flipper Cheese Burger - Similar to Psychic burger, a good all-rounder.\nLucky Chip - The Donald Trump Burger - Finally got round to them at National Burger Day 2015! Excellent burger, but the toppings were the real draw to this one. Very flavourful and I wolfed it down. \nByron - Classic/Cheese - The one that started it all, subsequent specials have been hit-or-miss, but I'm still fond of the classic.\nTommi's Burger Joint - Burger - No frills, just delicious.\nDirty Burger - Dirty Cheeseburger - Still good, but drops down the ranking with each repeat visit…\nMeatMarket/MeatLiquor - The Dead Hippie - Love the sauce on this one, sometimes inconsistent with the meat.\nMeat and Shake - Smoking Bandit - The meat pattie is unfortunately the weakness, but everything else is tasty and I do enjoy eating it."

Er beschäftigt sich seit 20 Jahren mit Wein und hat mit großer Sorgfalt eine umfangreiche Karte zusammengestellt. 160 verschiedene Weine sind dort thematisch sortiert. Ein Beispiel sind die „Fabulous 7“ hinter denen sich sieben Rebsorten, die weltweit zu Hause sind, verbergen. Echte Klassiker der Weinwelt wie ein Barolo Bussia Docg oder ein Charmbertin Grand Cru, sowie eine große Auswahl an Perlweinen und „Big Bottles“ gehören ebenfalls zu unserem Angebot.

"Restaurants","Golden Corral Sat06/20/15 w/Tom Rak","Sat06/20/15@6pm: I went to Golden Corral on Indy Blvd. in Schererville with Tom Rak after the White Sox Game today.\n\nI was really surprised to see that almost all the customers AND almost all the workers were black now. Why is that? And in Schererville? What has happened? That was quite shocking. I could understand an integrated mix of races...But this was like being in the heart of Gary. Wow.\n\nAnd of course, almost all of the people were overweight, and there were many severely obese people; where they should not be, doing what they should not do.\n\nIt did not seem as good to me now, and I enjoyed it much less, but I started to feel kinda bad right when I started eating, so I don't know if I enjoyed it less because I wasn't feeling so good or what...But it definitely has much more of a ghetto feel to it now, and it doesn't seem as nice and as clean and as good now. It looked like a black man was in charge now, and he was acting in a way that brought to mind things that Kim Sims had said....\n\nSo I enjoyed it much less this time, and it seemed much less good now, but there were several things going on at the same time to cloud the issue. I enjoyed the Food King China Buffet much more than this yesterday when I was there, and I enjoyed the China Buffet on Indy Blvd across from Walmart much more than I enjoyed the Golden Corral today.\n\nSo this is a scary sign to me...Quite earth-shaking. What is happening to the Calumet Region now? I see the changes in Griffith...And I still remember that meeting years ago at Bill McPhillips house which seemed very significant to me during very crazy and weird times.\n\n\n***\n\n"

"Restaurants","todo 2","Update 2014-05-18，终于补完了。\n\n吃货在湾区近两年。实际上如果有车并且不介意开车的话，湾区附近可吃的还是很多。另外我之前十几年都在新加坡，养成了一个淫荡的胃，什么菜好吃就可以。所以口味不一定和大家完全一样。\n\n大陆 / 香港\n出国太早外加没有遍历祖国大好河山，对于中餐的认识基本上就是 吃过最好吃的川菜~= 新加坡最好吃的川菜（我来美帝之后还关门了）。\n\n清真一条龙 Milpitas\n湾区少数我觉得值得推荐的一家。大饼，鱼香茄子，羊肉。\n\n京味轩 Milpitas\n湾区另一家推荐的。北京菜，有炒肝和酸奶。火锅的羊肉很好。夜宵有烧烤，但从来没吃过。\n\n御食园 三番 Chinatown\n虽然不在硅谷，还是推荐一下。是我在美国吃到最好的川菜。需要排队。\n\n岭南小馆 三番\n只是和朋友去过一次，但还是推荐。本人不好鸡肉，但他们的豉油鸡是我除了新加坡的海南鸡饭外，第二个单纯因为鸡肉的香滑而赞叹的。\n\n五月花 Milpitas\n粤式。不便宜，菜不错。只去过一次，而且只有两个人，所以评价未必公允。\n\n老赵 Mountain View\n因为近所以常去。川菜做得中规中矩，我反而更喜欢他家的羊肉串和韭菜盒子。\n\n岳阳楼 (Chef Yu) Sunnyvale Downtown\n湖南菜。但湾区的中餐大多都是兼收并包什么都做。菜做得不错，而且通常不用排队。常点酸菜鱼。\n\n韶山冲 Fremont\n很多人推荐，所以很多人排队。去过两次还是觉得很一般。叫过一次名声在外的剁椒鱼头，略为失望。\n\n大四川 Palo Alto\n川菜，只一个人去过一次，印象不深。\n\n麻辣诱惑 Fremont\n火锅不错。吃过一次麻辣香锅，不推荐。\n\n三好拉面 Cupertino，Milpitas\n连锁，羊肉泡馍可以吃一下。鉴于湾区没有找到什么特别好的面，偶尔还会来这里。\n\n北京食府 Cupertino\n新开，没有预订建议不要去。大概是因为厨房出菜慢，排队很久。据称有羊蝎子，但排了近两个小时后告知没有。烤鸭需要预订，也没吃过。火锅还不错，但觉得京味轩更好些。目前只去过一次。\n\n津蒜子 San Jose（更接近Milpitas）\n天津菜。有煎饼果子和豆腐脑。菜说不上好，但还算有特色。\n\n五饼二鱼 Milpitas\n东北菜。可以偶尔换下口味。\n\n杨师傅烧烤 Cupertino\n南湾唯一的一家烧烤。但每次去都会吐槽，烤的东西没有一样是平均水平以上的。以前的干丝不错，最近一次去，干丝的口感都差了很多。\n\n香港餐馆 Palo Alto\n粤式炒菜，因为近去过几次，基本没什么印象。\n\n顺峰渔港 Fremont\n茶点比富临门贵，但也更好吃。如果不是略远，大概去得会更多。\n\n富临门 Mountain View\n粤式茶点，晚上也有炒菜。去的原因主要是因为近。\n\nTODO 鲤鱼门\n号称湾区最好的茶点。\n\nTODO 巴山蜀水 Milpitas\n一个做饭很好的四川大叔推荐，但一直还没去。\n\n台湾\n\n好客栈 Cupertino\n很推荐的一家台湾菜，三杯系列很入味。只是需要排队。雪花冰也不错。\n\n台南风味小馆 Cupertino\n中规中矩，发现好客栈和Mama Chef后就没去过了。\n\nMama Chef, Cupertino\n我在湾区最喜欢的牛肉面。面劲道，汤的味道正好，牛肉倒是可以更入味些，加上咸菜让人食欲大开。第一次去只要了小碗，第二天意犹未尽又去吃了个大腕。\n\n元宝 Mountain View\n有朋友很喜欢他家的牛肉面，但我觉得味道太重。卤肉饭倒是不错。\n\nMama Chen's Kitchen, Cupertino\n面和菜的种类更多，可以去试试找自己喜欢的。\n\nSushi\n在湾区着实找过一阵Sushi。好的Sushi在Yelp上评分都不错，但是Yelp上评分好的不一定好，毕竟在加州这个“发明”出California Roll的地方，很多人都骄傲的自称为roll person。另外如果你寿司/Sashimi里最喜欢的是三文鱼，我喜欢的你可能会觉得没有性价比。\n\nSushi Tomi, Mountain View\n有很多连锁。中规中矩，性价比不错。鱼不多。\n\nNiji Sushi, Mountain View\n厨师和服务生都是中国人。比Sushi Tomi略微差一点。\n\nKappo Nami Nami, Mountain View\nCastro上最好的sushi。但出了Mountain View比他好的还有一些。\n\nFuki Sushi, Palo Alto\n不便宜，鱼种多，size小。推荐Sushi Bar的Omakase，十片男生通常吃不饱，我没饿的一次是叫了18片，不过才80说不得贵。\n\nAkane, Los Altos\n虽然没有Omakase，但是鱼很新鲜。单纯比较寿司的话，我喜欢他躲过Fuki。\n\nJin Sho, Palot Alto\n号称是Jobs生前最喜欢的餐馆之一。他们的Omakase是dishes + sushi，而且据说根据去的次数不同上的菜也不一样。菜很不错，sushi种类很多，大厨一道道介绍鱼的来历，但是味道却没有惊艳。\n\nSam's Edomata, San Mateo\n湾区最好的Omakase之一。他们的sushi上基本都有酱料，不完全是鱼本身的味道，但同样美味。不介意钱包的话，强烈推荐。\n\nSakae Sushi, Burlingame\n我在湾区吃到最好的Omakase。鱼很新鲜，toro，uni和scallop都是我吃过最好的之一。不过这家也大概是最贵的之一。毕竟sushi的好坏和价钱成正比。\n\n拉面\nShalala, Mountain View\n大概是Castro最火的拉面。招牌的Miso Ramen不错，但是汤头太重。实际上他家的咖哩饭也不错。\n\nMaru Ichi, Mountain View\n也在Castro，里面的肉不错。不过后来就只吃soba了。\n\nRamen House Ryowa, Mountain View\n另一家还不错的ramen。但特别没什么印象深刻的地方。\n\nDohatsuten, Mountain View\n柚子风味的miso ramen。面和汤头一般，料里面有很多蔬菜。适合偶尔换下口味。\n\nOrenchi, Cupertino\n或许是南湾最火的拉面。很久之前去过一次，因为排队太久后来没去过，印象不深，也说明没有什么挑得出问题的地方。或许也是南湾最好的拉面。\n\n山头火, San Jose\n在超市里面，面不够劲道，汤也一般，觉得名不副实。\n\n其他日本菜\nGochi, Mountain View / Cupertino\nFusion tapas。招牌菜都不错。\n\n韩餐\nKunjip, Santa Clara\n韩国牛肉汤。菜单很少，推荐2号的牛肉汤。如果喜欢浓汤的话，牛尾汤也不错。\n\nBon Chon Chicken, Sunnyvale\n湾区最好的炸鸡。Spicy的实际上不辣，original的味道可能有些淡。不过人一直很多，推荐提前打电话togo。\n\nSGD Tofu House, Palo Alto\n我在湾区最喜欢的豆腐汤，实际上主要是喜欢他们的小菜。Sunnyvale也有家SGD，但实际上不是一家。\n\nJang Su Jang, Sunnyvale\n一个韩国朋友推荐的。很不错的烤肉，但水平有波动，取决于server。\n\n西餐\nThe Crepevine, Mountain View\nCrepe和pasta都不错。Cheese cake和其他的地方不大一样，但也很好吃。\n\nThe Cheese Cake Factory, Santa Clara\n很多家，和TBBT里面不一样。队总是很长，我通常都只是打包cheese cake。cheese cake确实很fresh。\n\nTexas Road House, Union City\n连锁的牛排点，性价比不错。肉有味道，但是sause的味道对于我来说太重，更喜欢单纯的肉味。\n\nThe Grill on The Alley, San Jose\n环境很好，牛排尚可，价钱不低，适合约会。\n\nSundance The Steakhouse, Palo Alto\n在他家只试过Slow-roasted prime rib，很特殊。\n\nAlexander's Steakhouse, Cupertino\n米其林一星，号称是湾区最好的牛排。但实际上更像一个fusion restaurant，而不是steakhouse。Dry-aged ribeye steak很不错。菜也不错，推荐hamachi和mac & cheese。另外饭后有棉花糖。他们家还有和牛，但我很尊重@Wuvist花了很多学费得出和牛不适合牛排的结论。\n\nLos Altos Grill, Los Altos\n@Wang Erdong 的推荐\n唯一让我时刻回味，并超越纽约的是Los Altos Grill的prime rib。必须要吃4:30pm的第一块牛排，这是主厨亲自做的，5:00以后的牛排就一般般了。记住必须4:15之前到，晚了就和吃普通牛排没什么两样\n虽然我没在4:30之前吃过，但是仍然觉得这是湾区最好的牛排之一。另外我觉得纽约的Wolfgang比他家更好。\n\nManresa, Los Gatos\n米其林两星。两星的体验，两星的价钱，不过很容易订位。\n\nMadera, Menlo Park\n米其林一星，但大概只是晚饭。我去的时候是午饭，食物的选择不多，但价格很亲民。周边景色很好，适合约会。\n\n其他\nCascal, Mountain View\nTapas。种类很多，味道各异，总体不错。\n\nSakoon, Mountain View\n印度同事推荐的印度菜，我不偏爱印度菜也很喜欢。午饭有buffet。\n\nMango Garden, San Jose\n新加坡菜，虽然辣椒螃蟹不是真正的新加坡的辣椒螃蟹，roti prata被用来当前菜，但有些菜还是很地道，比如新加坡的招牌青菜马来风光（Samba 空心菜）。\n\nBoiling Crab, San Jose\n重口味海鲜，大家大概都知道。不推荐小龙虾。螃蟹，虾，和clams都很容易入味。\n编辑于 2014-05-18"

Nachtjäger, Badenerstrasse 310","À LA CARTE\nJagdglück\nUrs Bühler Bei all den Haaren in der Suppe, die zum täglichen Brot eines Restaurantkritikers gehören, macht es richtig Freude, ab und zu voll des Lobes zu sein. Anlass bietet das Restaurant «Nachtjäger» im Kreis 4, das sich in einer ehemaligen Bar innert eines Jahres ohne viel Tamtam zu einer der empfehlenswertesten Adressen in Zürich gemausert hat: Die Küche bietet ein tolles Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis, der Essraum eine einladende Mischung aus verspielten Details und nordischer Schlichtheit, die Kellnerin ist bei unserem Besuch auf der hübschen kleinen Terrasse so motiviert und prima informiert, wie man's in dieser Stadt selten findet. Sie arbeitet offenbar erst seit kurzem hier – man kann ihren Chefs nur empfehlen, sie zu behalten.\nDas Lokal, ein Schwesterbetrieb des «Café Boy», wird geführt von der Gastgeberin Patricia Gerber und dem Küchenchef Kevin Ashbrook, einem gebürtigen Engländer, der unter anderem unter Antonio Colaianni im «Il Casale» begann und ihm dann ins «Clouds» folgte. Der junge Mann beherrscht sein Handwerk, ohne dies mit überspannten Kreationen beweisen zu müssen. Das Resultat ist eine zeitgemäss leichte Küche ohne Scheu vor Seitensprüngen ins Deftige, geprägt von souveränem Spiel der Aromen und Texturen.\nAls Vorspeise begeistert die Kalbsbrust (Fr. 16.50) aus dem Green Egg, dem in der Spitzengastronomie hochgelobten Keramik-Grill der Stunde, mit knusprigen Zwiebelringen und asiatisch inspiriertem Bohnensalat, perfekt im Biss und mit ganzen Haselnüssen (die sich gehackt wohl noch etwas harmonischer einfügen würden). Einzig die Paarung aus Kabeljau und Miso (Fr. 33.–) überzeugt wegen der bitteren Note nicht ganz, anders als die Artischocken-Ravioli mit feinsten Kefen-Julienne (Fr.26.–) oder das ideal gegarte Secreto-Stück vom Iberico-Schwein (Fr. 33.–) an katalanischer Romesco-Sauce. Auch das Dessert zeugt von Könnerschaft, von pochierten Aprikosen mit Beurre noisette und Fenchelsamen-Eis (Fr. 12.–) bis zur Hausspezialität: Tarte citron mit leicht caramelisierter Oberfläche und Sauerrahm-Glace (Fr. 14.–),\nWie aber kann eine Küche so beachtlichen Aufwand betreiben und dabei die Preise so moderat halten? Wir erfahren, dass eine benachbarte IT-Firma den Betrieb exklusiv als Kantine nutzt und der Crew so mittags eine Umsatzgarantie beschert. Womöglich ein Geschäftsmodell, das Schule machen könnte?\nNachtjäger, Badenerstrasse 310, 8004 Zürich, Tel. 043 931 77 90. So/Mo geschlossen."

"Restaurants","Konstanz papageno","Das „Papageno“ ist ein wahrer Glücksfall für die Stadt am See und ein Pilgertempel für alle, die noch auf solides Küchenhandwerk mit reichlich Akkuratesse Wert le- gen. Dieses Haus ist einen Um- weg wirklich wert.\nRestaurant „Papageno“, Hüetlinstraße 8a, 78462 Konstanz, Tel.: 07531/368 660, www.restaurant-papageno.net.\n￼￼￼zahlt werden darf. Der Gastrono- mie der Stadt tut das ganz gut, wird sie doch von zahlreichen Schweizern aufgesucht, die zum günstigen Kurs einkehren und ihre Währung gegen deutsche Kohlen- hydrate eintauschen. Zum Beispiel im Restaurant „Papageno“, mitten in der historischen Altstadt.\nHier steht Johann Kraxner am Herd, ein gebürtige Grazer, und sorgt dafür, dass es sich bei dieser Institution um ein Gasthaus han- delt, das viele Tugenden repräsen- tiert, für die wir hier beinahe Freu- dentränen vergießen, zum Beispiel wegen der Tischdecken. Gestärkt aus weißem Kattun, bedecken sie die schwarzbraunen Tische im Speisesaal, der sich ein paar Stufen über dem Straßenpflaster erhebt. Wo gibt es das denn noch, dass die Augen des Gastes mit blankem und ruhigem Weiß erfreut wer- den?\nDoch auch die Vorspeisen ma- chen dem Ort alle Ehre: eine Con- sommé mit geräucherten Boden- seefischen (13 Euro) ebenso wie die Fettuccine mit gebratener Gän- seleber (26 Euro). Simpel aber gut: die klare Fischessenz mit fein aro-\n31 Euro) sowie Steinbutt mit Lauch-Kartoffel-Gemüse und ge- trockneten Tomaten (für 39 Euro). Die Tranche vom Dorsch türmt sich als regelrechtes Gibral- tar auf dem Teller und ist perfekt mitsamt der Haut gebraten. Beim Essen dann zerfällt der Fisch in äu- ßerst saftige Partien mit glasiger Struktur, die ein Fleisch offenbart,"

The head chef changes the vegetables based on what tickles his fancy each week; our meals were served with soft potatoes, roasted onions and glazed carrots. Cost: $29\n\nReview: In delightful when-steak-met-roast style, the roast beef was an Australian rib eye steak thickly sliced and seared in mustard. Roast of the day was tender sous vide pork bathed for over 48 hours and finished off in the oven alongside caramelised apples. For dessert, we tucked into a traditional apple and rhubarb crumble with a hearty blob of ice cream.The décor is retro, from the first Nintendo and cassette players to an original Pacman arcade game, which will keep the kids amused – and your other half, too, if you’re not careful.\n\n"

"Restaurants","The French Laundry (Yountville, Calif.)","http://www.thomaskeller.com/yountville-california/french-laundry/make-reservation\n\nThomas Keller’s legendary restaurant sits in a building that is 115 years old, and that’s about how long it will take for you to get a table here. Just kidding! It’s only a measly two months. There’s a reason for its popularity: Anthony Bourdain calls it “the best restaurant in the world. Period.” With a nine-course chef’s tasting menu and a nine-course vegetable tasting — no ingredients are used more than once — we believe him."
"Restaurants","Talula’s Table (Kennett Square, Penn.)","It isn’t that you could possibly wait up to a year for a table at Talula’s Table; you definitely have to call 365 days in advance, as per the restaurant’s requirements. The 22-seat restaurant, which has only two tables, is a farm-to-table at the back of an indoor market. The lucky person who actually gets a reservation is responsible for filling 10 seats; the rest are owner Aimee Olexy’s invitees."

ElBulli’s Ferran Adrià and his brother Albert opened this avant-garde tapas eatery in the molecular gastronomic style that made elBulli legendary, with items like Manchego cheese foam in a ""mini-airbag"" (a lighter-than-air baguette), oysters with passion-fruit caipirinha sauce, and pancakes with waffle foam yogurt."
"Restaurants","Schwa (Chicago)","http://schwarestaurant.com/\n\nWith 26 seats and an average of 60 phone calls a day, Schwa in Chicago, which has an estimated wait time of one to three months, has garnered some notoriety for being horrible at returning phone calls. The restaurant’s website rarely shuts down, because it doesn’t take reservations in any way besides over the phone. The current menu features items like apple pie soup and tagliatelle with huckleberries, black truffle, and veal heart."
"Restaurants","Sukiyabashi Jiro (Tokyo)","Jiro may dream of sushi, but you’ll be dreaming of a reservation at his restaurant. In order to reserve a seat at the tiny Sukiyabashi Jiro, you’ll not only have to book a month in advance, but also have a Japanese local (a friend or your hotel concierge) vouch for you. To confirm your reservation, your Japanese contact needs to deliver ¥20,000 (about $200) to Jiro himself."
"Restaurants","Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare (Brooklyn)","http://www.brooklynfare.com/pages/chefs-table\n\nTucked away in the back of a high-end supermarket, chef Cesar Ramirez hosts 18 lucky reservation-getters every evening around his kitchen counter space — which also happens to be the only restaurant in Brooklyn with three Michelin stars. Reservations must be made six weeks in advance, and you have to call in at 10:30 a.m. on Monday to book seats; let’s hope you’re one of the callers that actually gets through, because you don’t want to miss this 20 plus-course meal that relies heavily on shellfish."
"Restaurants","Next in Chicago","https://www.nextrestaurant.com/website/faq\n\nIf you want to get a ticket — yes, you have to get a ticket — to Grant Achatz's Next in Chicago, you’ll have to pay for the meal in advance, a full season ahead. The ever-changing menus have themes ideal for travel lovers, like “Paris 1900” and “Tour of Thailand,” the latter of which made the website shut down because so many people attempted to purchase tickets at the same time."
"Restaurants","Noma (Cophenhagen)","http://noma.dk/\n\nGoogle “the best restaurant in the world” and Noma, the Danish harborside restaurant stocked with excellent food that stays close to its Nordic terrain, will figure prominently in your search — even though it only has two Michelin stars. On the 6th of every month, eager diners wait by Noma’s online portal to book a table a minimum of three months ahead. Why? It’s a rare thing to see a menu item featuring green shoots as the main component of a meal and scallops as a marinade — and an even rarer thing to make it taste good."

"Restaurants","todo","作为在湾区前前后后待了快两年的吃货，一定要来答一答这道题。\n\n常常听人抱怨说，漂在海外，最苦的是舌头和胃。但是如果抛开对中餐的执念，似乎很快就会发现家乡菜也不过是全球美食版图上的一个犄角旮旯，只不过浓重的回忆和思念把这块角落放大到无限。答主虽然谈不上阅历丰富，但也游历了许多地方。曾经在横滨某商场的地下一层面对一碗拉面感动得要流泪，也抱着Lonely Planet在巴黎左岸寻觅奇怪的黄油炸青蛙腿，不会忘记风雨交加的威尼斯抱着一盘生冷的帕尔玛火腿流口水，而去年吃过的最好的一顿饭，居然是在北密歇根州一个小镇上的连招牌都很难看到的新美式餐馆。\n\n唯有爱与美食不可辜负，真是一句放之四海而皆准的文艺宣言。\n\n说回硅谷。硅谷一般指的是三藩市以南，一直到San Jose市的南湾地区，不过东湾的Fremont那块儿，也被大家默认为硅谷的一部分。作为西海岸的宇宙中心，这块区域的美食丰富程度远不是我之前的几个答案所能概括的。\n\n下面来列餐馆吧（排名不分先后）。\n\n中餐（包括广式点心和台湾菜，）：\n1 韶山冲\n\n位于Fremont，Yelp地址：Shao Mountain\n泛硅谷地区最好吃的湘菜，甚至是味道最好的中餐之一。菜品丰富，辣椒够味，适合无辣不欢的同学。周末排队成狗，注意做好准备。\n\n推荐菜品：双味鱼片，木桶藕，青菜钵，酸豆角\n\n2 台南风味\n\n位于Cupertino大华超市旁边，Yelp地址：Southland Flavor Cafe\n被我台湾同学鉴定过、且赞不绝口的台湾菜，而且是不远万里从东部飞来湾区后，点名要吃的餐馆。\n\n推荐菜品：所有小菜，沙茶牛肉\n\n3 Taipan\n\n位于Palo Alto Downtown，Yelp地址：Taipan - Palo Alto, CA\n我最常去的中餐馆之一，因为在公司附近。每日中午有广式点心，种类不多，但是味道极佳。价格稍贵。\n\n推荐菜品：肠粉，海鲜羹，虾饺\n\n4 麻辣小站\n\n位于Cupertino苹果campus附近，Yelp地址：Spicy Station\n\n作为一个武汉人，能吃到鸭脖已经是泪流满面了。而且这家的鸭脖鸭翅味道还这么正，那么店面小，就餐环境一般也就不是问题了。另外酸辣粉味道很好，还有麻小常年供应。\n\n推荐菜品：上面提到的那些\n\n5 Steam\n\n位于Palo Alto Dowtown，Yelp地址：Steam - Palo Alto, CA\n\n作为一个中餐馆，它居然敢以开放厨房的方式营业，简直就是勇气非凡。菜品有些广式，味道非常不错。重点是他家的红烧牛肉面里的牛肉，炖的入口即化。而干炒牛河居然能差不多做到“吃完盘子上没有多余的油和酱油”。\n\n推荐菜品：红烧牛肉面，干炒牛河，海鲜面\n\n日本菜：\n1 Tanto\n\n位于Sunnyvale的El Camino Real上，Yelp地址：Tanto Japanese Restaurant\n可能是湾区最有特色的日本居酒屋，很小的店面，有丰富的小菜和清酒、烧酒选择。也有暖人的日式火锅和新鲜的鱼生。周末有长队。另外这家店对面有家叫Sawa的寿司店，人均200刀起，走的是寿司之神的风格，还没有亲自尝过，据说菜品一流。\n\n推荐菜品：除寿司外的所有，反正吃了这么多次还么有让我失望的东西。\n\n2 Kappo Nami Nami\n\n位于Mountain View Downtown，Yelp地址：Kappo Nami Nami\n很低调的店面，很精致的装修。跟上面的Tanto同是日式风格，但是这家更有创新菜的感觉。曾经一个人坐在寿司吧前一壶清酒几碟小菜度过一个愉快的周五晚上。\n\n推荐菜品：好吃的太多，菜单上有啥就点啥吧\n\n3 Maru Ichi\n\n位于Mountain View Downtown，Yelp地址： Maru Ichi - Mountain View, CA\n小小的日本拉面店，汤头应该是熬出来的，鲜而不腻，而面很劲道。虽然味道比不上在日本吃过的正宗拉面，但是用来解馋绰绰有余。\n\n推荐菜品：所有拉面，炸鸡\n\n西餐（欧洲和新美式）：\n1 Evvia Estiatorio（希腊菜式）\n\nPalo Alto Downtown最高级的餐馆之一，Yelp地址：Evvia Estiatorio\n乔布斯生前是这里的常客，他的传记里专门提到过这家餐馆。慕名去过一次，味道很好，服务态度极佳，用餐环境一流。非常贵，三个人吃午餐没喝酒差不多一共花了200刀（加小费和税）。\n\n推荐菜品：Lamb Shank\n\n2 Pizzeria Delfina（意式Pizza）\n\n一个规模不大的连锁，大概有四家分店，我去的是Palo Alto那家，Yelp地址：Pizzeria Delfina\n这是法国来的同事主动推荐我们去的一家。为什么要强调法国人？因为法国人跟中国人一样觉得自家的食物天下第一，所以能让他唠唠叨叨半个月然后大中午排队等着的pizza，一定不会差。注意这里的pizza是传统意式，经过我鉴定，跟在意大利吃过的pizza味道不分伯仲。\n\n推荐菜品：Pizza，Gelato（意式冰淇淋），意式火腿头盘\n\n\n东南亚：\n1 Xahn（越南菜，Asian Fusion）\n\n位于Mountain View Dowtown，Yelp地址：Xanh Restaurant\n这家店好久没去过了，只记得很好吃，选择很多，从传统的越南春卷，到比较创新的烤鸭胸都有，另外有一款荔枝口味的鸡尾酒非常不错。\n\n推荐菜品：Happy hour时候的鸡尾酒和小菜\n\n2 Siam Fine Thai Cuisine（泰国菜）\n\n位于San Jose的一个shopping mall对面，Yelp地址：Siam Fine Thai Cuisine\n总体说来在美国泰国菜很流行，但是Palo Alto Downtown一条街上就有两三家，但味道一般都是中规中矩。这家是我印象最深的了，虽然也是很久没去光顾的馆子。店面很小，总要排队，Pad Thai这种炒面都被它做得很惊艳，另外还有各种泰国小炒，都值得一试。\n\n其他：\n1 Boiling Crab\n\n海鲜连锁店，San Jose店Yelp：The Boiling Crab\n好像老板是个亚裔，菜如其名，简单粗暴，各种海鲜用煮或者炖的方法，放在塑料袋里上桌，然后就摊开在桌上用手抓着吃。味道却出奇的好，可能主要是食材新鲜，就连生蚝也还不错。另外这里还有小龙虾供应。另外可以选辣的程度，不能吃辣的同学们有蒜香可以备用。\n\n推荐菜品：大螃蟹和大虾\n\n2 Oren’s Hummus Shop （地中海风味）\n\n位于Palo Alto Down，Yelp地址：Oren's Hummus Shop\nHummus是中东特色菜，就是鹰嘴豆泥，口感跟土豆泥类似，但是比土豆泥要细腻而且不会有那么多油。第一次吃的时候，配合pita（中东圆面饼）和他家特制的辣椒酱，对我的中国味蕾来说绝对是难得的新奇好体验。另外这个地方也是排队成狗的热门地点。\n\n推荐菜品：蘑菇Hummus，Chiken Skewer， Lemonade（饮品）\n\n3 Coconuts Caribbean Restaurant & Bar (加勒比海风味）\n\n位于Palo Alto Downtown，Yelp地址：Coconuts Caribbean Restaurant & Bar\n这可能又是一个国内比较少见的风格。他们的菜造型都一般，但是有独门酱料jerk sauce（难道翻译成混蛋酱？）坐镇，只要沾上这酱的食物，就好吃到爱不释手。Jerk sauce似乎是牙买加的特产，辣酱配合那边的香料做成的，具体请移步：Jamaican jerk spice\n\n推荐菜品：Jerk Chiken，慢炖牛尾（！）\n\n4 Share tea 歇脚亭 （奶茶）\n\n位于San Mateo Downtown，Yelp地址：Sharetea - San Mateo, CA\n硅谷的奶茶店很多，这家是属于专门开车去喝，而不是吃完饭顺便去一趟的那种。\n\n唔，暂时就写到这里，因为答主半夜答题已经饿到不行……\n\n不过此答案会持续更新，答主要是发现了什么新的好馆子，会及时加进来。如果大家有好的推荐也请留言，待答主鉴定过后，会添加进来。\n编辑于 2014-05-14"

The restaurant building was originally constructed as a home and went through a number of owners before Uncle Bill McElroy moved in and started serving pancakes in 1961. Uncle Bill offers 12 varieties of pancakes and the Cake & Eggs, two buttermilk pancakes with two eggs any style. The Strawberry sounds really great right now with its fresh strawberries and whipped cream or maybe you can try something more season like the pumpkin spice."

"Restaurants","Sans gluten","Crudessence\nDeux adresses à Montréal\ncrudessence.com\nBiologique, végétalien, vivant, sans gluten. Voici les mots d’ordre du Crudessence, dont l’approche résolument audacieuse a gagné de nombreux adeptes, que ces derniers aient un régime alimentaire particulier ou non. Soupes, sushis végé, salades, lasagnes, enchiladas, boissons étudiées. L’art de la gastronomie mis au service de la santé. Une référence.\n2 – Crêperie du Marché\n7070, avenue Henri Julien, Montréal (Marché Jean-Talon)\n514 238-0998\ncreperiedumarche.com\nOn savait déjà que les crêpes de Jérôme Arlabosse étaient parmi les meilleures en ville, mais c’est également dans sa petite crêperie qu’à présent, vous aurez la garantie de préparations sans gluten. Effectivement, en plus des crêpes de sarrasin naturellement sans gluten, on y propose des crêpes sucrées dont l’appareil est composé d’un assemblage de farines de riz brun, de sarrasin et de pois chiches, toutes trois biologiques. Même la traditionnelle sauce béchamel a été retravaillée. Pssst! Pour les gourmands qui sont au centre-ville ou dans le Vieux-Port, la Crêperie du Marché ouvrira en mai et jusqu’à la fin de l’été, une petite annexe juste à côté de la Cité des Sciences.\n3 – Propulsion : cantine végétalienne\n1303, rue Sainte Catherine Est, Montréal\n514 664-1113\ncantinepropulsion.com\nOuvert il y a moins d’un an par Shawn Picard, un artiste de Sudbury qui est entre autres écrivain, spécialiste de cocktails et chef cuisinier, Propulsion est à la fois un resto et un lieu créatif où concerts et expos se succèdent. On y déguste des sandwichs, salades, bols-santé, smoothies et desserts, pour la plupart sans gluten.\n 4 – Ottavio pizza\n1459, boulevard Saint-Martin Ouest, Laval\n450 663-7966\nottavio.ca\nDe la pizza sans gluten? Eh bien oui, ça existe. Ottavio attire même, selon nos sources, sur la Rive-Nord des cœliaques vivant sur la Rive-Sud. Pourquoi? Parce qu’on y fait extrêmement attention à la contamination croisée, d’une part, ce qui est rare dans les restaurants, et bien sûr parce que les pizzas y sont très bonnes, d’autre part. Le restaurant propose même, en parallèle à son menu central, un menu complet sans gluten comportant des entrées, des pâtes et des moules-frites.\n5 – Aux Vivres\n4631, boulevard Saint-Laurent, Montréal\n514 842-3479\nauxvivres.com\nHaut lieu, depuis des années, de la cuisine santé accessible à Montréal et des amateurs, l’été, de terrasses, le restaurant Aux Vivres a un menu totalement végétalien dans lequel sont identifiés un certain nombre de plats sans gluten, voire sans gluten, sans soya et sans noix. Idéal pour les personnes souffrant de plusieurs allergies, donc, mais aussi pour celles que le gluten ne dérange pas.\n6 –  Régine Café\n1840, rue Beaubien Est, Montréal\n514 903-0676\nreginecafe.ca\nManger un bon brunch sans gluten au resto sans être confiné à l’éternel smoothie, c’est possible au Régine Café. Encensé par la critique, cet endroit ravissant et pourvu d’un menu misant sur des produits de qualité et bien travaillés a réservé quatre choix aux adeptes de sans gluten. On y retrouve des plats version santé (yogourt avec poire pochée) ou plus gourmande, comme une gauffre sans gluten avec gravlax de truite maison et crème fraîche."

You didn't have a jacket so you were shivering a little bit and decided to build yourself a pillow fort!\n\nWe ordered the mac and cheetos with bacon and mushroom… mmmmmm. so heavy, but so delicious!

"Restaurants","Ace Hotel","We celebrated your birthday here!!!\n\nI'll admit, I was very anxious and nervous to meet all of the people who you have met and kept in touch with throughout your 25 year journey in this world. All of these people came out to celebrate your birthday because they all care, and I'm so happy to know that the girl I'm with is so awesome that 40+ people came out! O_O\n\nPlease don't try to quiz me on the names because I'd maybe be able to list 20 at best. haha. All in all, it was such a great night babe. I know things got stressful at times, but I was so happy and so excited to meet everyone. I also felt so special when you'd say, ""Hey (enter a friend's name)! This is Ben, my boyfriend!"" Thank you for making me feel special cutie. You have no idea how lucky I feel to be your boyfriend and to have such an amazing girlfriend like you! \n\nI think I got to meet everyone you wanted me to meet for the most part, so let's call this night a success! ^__^ That plus you got drunk in good company. There's still plenty of time for us to spend quality time with your friends who couldn't be there or couldn't hang (like me two weeks prior -_-). Happy birthday, cutie, and just know that I love you very much, Eileen! Cuz you're my shnookums boogums!!!! XD"
"Restaurants","All That BBQ","After being heavily discouraged by Ronald, I still went ahead and talked to Eileen after our bball game. James was making faces at me telling me, ""Go for it… it's not that serious, don't worry!""\n\nWhile we were all waiting to be seated, everyone was playing Trivia Crack, and I decided to join in since I noticed that Eileen was playing too. I challenged her to a game and to not look like a dumby, I recruited the assistance of JK and Ksar to beat her! \n\nWhen we finally got our table, I went to the bathroom to wash my hands, and was pleasantly surprised  when I returned to the table that the only remaining seat available was the one next to Eileen. \n\nI had to order AYCE vegetarian, and Eileen asked me, ""Are you vegetarian? O_o"" with a very judgmental facial expression. I told her no and that I had another game. We then bonded over the fact that her beef tongue was soooo delicious, and I think I may have gotten some pity points for sitting next to her eating my grilled veggies and fried rice while she DEVOURED her 4 (or was it 5?) orders of beef tongue. \n\nI left before the rest of the team for my second bball game, and after the game, I checked my phone to find a message through Trivia Crack. It was from Eileen!!! She wished me luck and also made fun of me for eating vegetarian all in the same message. I think she was still bitter from me beating her in Trivia Crack…\n\nTo say that that was a great night would be an understatement. :)"

White fish"" \nYou: ""That's my favorite here too!""\nMe: ""Garlic butter or Cajun?""\nYou: ""Garlic butter!!!""\nMe: ""Haha. Dang.

Enjoyed churros with lemon raspberry ice cream, macchiato, and cacao latte before heading to Colorado St. bridge. Enjoyed a nice view of Pasadena and DTLA from Sierra Madre. Shared first kiss with Eileen after making fun of her for being key club president. Finished the night playing 1 vs. 1 heads up before dropping her back off at home. "

They start with a homemade flour tortilla, then a piece of tender fried chicken and top it with a mixture of fresh corn, chili mayo, Cotija cheese and cilantro.\n\nThe Wheel\nOne of the first things you’ll notice when you walk into The Original El Taco is that they hand each person a token with a number on it. Then you’ll see the giant wheel hanging behind the bar. Move a little closer and you’ll realize that there are prizes on that wheel…’Free Taco’, ‘Dessert’, ‘Free Pitcher of Margaritas’ ?!?! Every hour they spin that wheel and someone comes away with a tasty prize. What will you win?!\n\nMexican Pizza"

"Restaurants","Los Altos food tips","Tasty culinary scene\n\nThe diverse population of the Bay Area, access to the freshest produce and a devoted artisanal food movement combine to offer a variety of top-notch local food choices.\n\nRecommendations from local residents are always valuable - everyone is sure to have a list of favorites. Following are a few of mine.\n\n• Los Altos Grill, 233 Third St. Hearty food and live music make this popular eatery the ideal choice for date nights and family birthday dinners.\n\n• Casa Lupe, 185 Main St. The casual atmosphere enhances the thoughtfully prepared Mexican food.\n\n• Esther’s German Bakery, 987 N. San Antonio Road. The excellent bread, fresh salads and hidden jewel of a beer garden make this a fun spot.\n\n• Cafe Vitale, 987 Fremont Ave. Loyola Corners residents are sure to become regulars at this tasty Italian cafe.\n\n• Bumble, 145 First St. Housed in a lovely old cottage, Bumble is the ideal spot for mothers with young children. The kids can play while the moms have coffee and converse.\n\nFor eating in, the area has a number of markets and farms with passionate and informed employees. A few favorite food sources:\n\n• Draeger’s Market, 342 First St. The customer service and selection at this independently owned grocery store are unsurpassed.\n\n• Dittmer’s Gourmet Meats & Wurst-Haus, 4540 El Camino Real. The old-fashioned butcher shop supplies meats for summer barbecues and holiday dinners.\n\n• The Milk Pail Market, 2585 California St., Mountain View. The cheese selection is truly drool-worthy.\n\nFarmers’ Markets\n\n•  The Los Altos Farmers’ Market runs 4-8 p.m. Thursdays May through September on State Street.\n\n• The Mountain View Farmers’ Market is slated 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Sundays year-round in the Caltrain parking lot, 600 W. Evelyn Ave.\n\n• Craig Murray’s Garden on Dori Lane in Los Altos Hills offers organic produce on the honor system."

The accompanying sambar (spicy lentil dip) is rich and sweet, in the Chennai style, the coconut chutneys fresh (though only in two variants: red or green). Most of these meals cost under £3. It’s true that this South Indian and Sri Lankan café might not have the most alluring of interiors – it is lit like a Tamil truck-stop, with furniture the colour of Sunny Delight – but at least you get to see movies on the flatscreen TV by way of diversion. On our visit, we watched a portly hero wiggle his moustache through enough song-and-dance routines to have us begging for some masala chai as a fortification. Although the vegetarian choice is exemplary, the non-veg options are OK too: mutton and chicken, mostly. But we suggest sticking to the meat-free meals, as this is Dosa n Chutny’s forte; the classic breakfast and snack dishes are beautifully rendered."

Brooklyn Pancake House is one of the places that we stumbled upon in this area. It is essentially a New-Yorker style diner which offers a variety of sweet and savoury pancakes.\n\nBrooklyn Pancake House is listed in our guide to Tokyo’s Top 15 Cafes.\n\n1F Mode S, 6-14-12 Jingumae\nShibuya-ku, Tokyo\nTel: +81 03 3409 2018\nDaily: 11.30am – 8pm\nNearest Station: Meiji-Jingumae/Harajuku "
"Restaurants","Tokyo - Nemuro Hanamaru","Don’t be deceived by the plain-looking conveyer belt sushi restaurant at Kitte Shopping Mall, which is a few minutes walk from Tokyo Station. Nemuro Hanamaru serves fresh sushi at great value. Most of the sushi plates are priced between ¥136 to ¥336. One of our favourites was the Seared Salmon (¥262). From the side menu, the Crab Soup (¥336) – with huge chunks of crab meat – and the Chawanmushi (¥262) are also excellent choices.\n\nNemuro Hanamaru is listed in our guide to Tokyo’s affordable sushi restaurants.\n\nTokyo KITTE 5F\n2-7-2 Marunouchi, Chiyoda-ku\nTel: +81 03 6269 9026\nMon to Sat: 11am – 11pm\nNearest Station: Tokyo "
"Restaurants","Due Italian","They have two signature ramen dishes and my friend and I decided to order one of each. The first one is the tomato ramen which is served cold and sweet with lots of tomatoes and some strawberries on top of it. The dish tasted deliciously fresh and I was quite surprised at how well the tomato juice and strawberries complemented each other.\n\nThe second signature dish is the hot ramen which is served with melted fromage cheese. This dish is very simple but the soup is exquisite. You mix the cheese and the noodles so they blend together and melts in your mouth. We just stopped talking until there wasn’t a drop left in our bowls. It was that good. "
"Restaurants","Tsukiji - Sushi Bun","Tokyo's central fish market is an essential part of most visitors' itineraries, and so is breakfast at one of its legendary hole-in-the-wall sushi counters. The seafood could hardly be fresher, and the sushi is as good as you'd expect at places charging four times as much. Sushi-Bun is one of the best in the market – it's just as tiny (10 seats at the counter at a pinch) and as tasty as the others, but it's left out of most guidebooks so the queues are usually shorter. Most people go for the set sushi menu (from £22 for eight servings of whatever seafood is in season, plus soup), which includes their succulent house-special, anago sea eel. The rough sake they serve with it, though, is far from premium.\n• 8 Chuo Shijo Building, 5-2-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, +81 3 3541 3860, tsukijinet.com, sushi chef's menu (omakase) from £22, English menu. Open Mon-Sat 6am-2.30pm, closed Sun and holidays"
"Restaurants","Shinjuku - Tsunahachi Rin","Tempura – batter-fried morsels of seafood and vegetables – is one of the supreme delicacies of Japanese cuisine and, like sushi, at the upper end it can cost a prince's ransom. Hidden away on the upper restaurant floor of a mall close to Shinjuku JR Station, Tsunahachi Rin proves it doesn't have to. Drawing a youngish demographic, it brings some innovative nuances to the tradition, such as serving a choice of four different kinds of salt with the tempura instead of just the standard soya-based dipping sauce. Drop in for a quick, affordable lunch of tendon (shrimp and a few cuts of vegetables served on rice), or settle in for a leisurely dinner, picking from the considerable side menu of sashimi and other Japanese delicacies. \n• Lumine 7F, 3-38-1 Shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, +81 3 3352 1012, tunahachi.co.jp, lunch from ¥1,260 (£10.50), dinner from ¥2,625 (£22), English menu.

"Restaurants","Nyc Fall 2015 preview NYTimes","Main Menu\nThe New York Times\nSearch\nSUBSCRIBEFood\n\nThe Fall Restaurant Preview\n\n\nALAN KIKUCHI FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES\nSEPTEMBER 8, 2015\nThese days, restaurants open in New York throughout the year, but fall still brings scores of fresh choices and a blast of energy. Florence Fabricant sizes up the season’s highlights, from pizzerias to formal dining rooms. (Dates may change.)\n\nSouth of 14th Street\n\nAmada Jose Garces, a chef of Ecuadorean descent who has made his mark in Philadelphia with several restaurants serving Latin cuisine, will open a New York version of his Amada, featuring Spanish tapas. (December): Brookfield Place, 200 Vesey Street (West Street).\n\nAvant Garden At this vegan newcomer, vegetables will be treated like meat, often roasted, braised and seared, with natural wines as accompaniment. (September): 130 East Seventh Street (First Avenue).\n\n\nBeSpoke Kitchen In addition to choosing from the à la carte entrees, diners can opt for the kitchen’s whim. Tell the waiter whether you prefer steak, fish, chicken or vegetables and leave the rest to the chef, Franco Barrio. “I think it’s fun to do it this way,” he said. (Tuesday): 615½ Hudson Street (Jane Street).\n\n\nBlack Seed Bagels The former De Robertis Pasticceria in the East Village, its tile floors and tin ceilings intact, is becoming the flagship for this company, whose bagels (a bit smaller, sweeter and maltier than the New York style) take their inspiration from Montreal. This space, with a wood-fired oven, will have a larger cafe area, a more elaborate menu and more room for wholesale baking than in the original store in NoLIta. (Sept. 17): 176 First Avenue (11th Street).\n\nCafé Altro Paradiso The chef Ignacio Mattos and his partner, Thomas Carter, who own the independent-minded small plate walk-up Estela, will now go Italian in a bright, airy space. They envision a more traditional menu, divided into starters, pastas, mains and desserts; they will do breakfast, lunch and dinner. (December): 234 Spring Street (Avenue of the Americas).\n\nCharlie Bird Robert Bohr, Ryan Hardy and Grant Reynolds of Charlie Bird in Greenwich Village are at work on a spinoff, yet to be named, for their brand of well-wrought American cooking. The chef in charge will be Tim Caspare, who was chef de cuisine at Quince and Cotogna in San Francisco. In the style of the latter, he’ll emphasize family-style platters. (November): 86 Kenmare Street (Mulberry Street).\n\n\nEureka at Creative Edge Flynn McGarry, 16, has been running a pop-up restaurant in Los Angeles called Eureka since he was 13. Carla Ruben, the owner of Creative Edge caterers and party space, which was the host for Mr. McGarry’s New York pop-up last year, has created a 12-seat chef’s counter, Creative Edge Studio. There he will produce 14-course dinners twice each evening on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays for the next six months, his most ambitious undertaking so far. Then he moves on to Miami. Prepaid reservations are accepted online at eurekanyc.com. Other chefs may be on tap down the line. (Saturday): 639 Washington Street (Barrow Street).\n\nFreud Seäsonal, the Austrian restaurant in Midtown that Eduard Fraunder owned with Wolfgang Ban, has closed, but the two still own Viennese-accented bars in the East Village. Now Mr. Fraunder will open an Austrian restaurant of his own, in a brasserie-style setting evoking fin de siècle Vienna. He aims to update classic schnitzels and such. (November): 506 La Guardia Place (Bleecker Street).\n\nGuenter Seeger This creative German-born chef, a star in Atlanta known for precision on the plate, closed his restaurant there and moved to New York in 2007. He has since worked to assemble a restaurant project, tangling most recently with landmark rules and other red tape. He’ll offer a single tasting menu, changing daily; there will also be a chef’s table. (October): 641 Hudson Street (Horatio Street).\n\nHarold’s Meat & Three No longer able to hang his toque at Commerce, which closed, Harold Moore has lined up a hotel gig, delivering comfort food in the Southern tradition: meat and three sides. (December): Tommie Hudson Square, 231 Hudson Street (Broome Street).\n\nHigh Street on Horatio Check your fear of carbs at the door and succumb to the breads that will emerge from an on-premises bakery run by Alex Bois, who has yet to meet a grain he doesn’t like. He is also proud of his classic and inventive bagels. Eli Kulp, the co-owner with Ellen Yin, put in time at Torrisi Italian Specialties, then opened a series of highly rated Philadelphia restaurants, including Fork and High Street on Market. Here, they’ll embrace vegetables and incorporate breads in many dishes. (November): 637 Hudson Street (Horatio Street).\n\nIl Bambino This branch of a panini shop in Astoria, Queens, owned by Sava Tsitiridis, Theo Mavromilhalis and the chef Darren Lawless will offer brunch instead of supper after 10:30 p.m. on weekends. (September): 48 West Eighth Street.\n\nKingsley The chef Roxanne Spruance, who was at Blue Hill and Alison Eighteen, will pursue French-American cuisine at her own place, a couple of years in the making. So far she plans dishes like pheasant with kabocha squash and black sesame, and heritage pork with blistered ground cherries and compressed carrots. (September): 190 Avenue B (12th Street).\n\nDan Kluger The renaissance of Eighth Street continues with this unnamed entry from Mr. Kluger, the former chef at Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s ABC Kitchen and ABC Cocina. He has taken over a former barbecue place, with 110 seats, a bar area, private rooms and a wood-burning oven and grill. His seasonal American fare will be heavy on vegetables, but don’t expect those delicious roasted carrots with avocado that everyone else has copied. “I’ll do something different with carrots,” he said. (December): 21-23 West Eighth Street.\n\n\nL’Appart The culinary director of the downtown food market Le District, Jordi Vallès, and his chef de cuisine, Nicolas Abello, will run this boutique 30-seat dining room inside the market, pairing tasting menus with wines. (November): Brookfield Place, 225 Liberty Street (West Street).\n\nLucky Bee Matty Bennett, who was the chef at Fat Radish on the Lower East Side and Longrain in Sydney, Australia, and Rupert Noffs, his Australian partner, are opening what they call a Southeast Asian farm-to-table restaurant with an emphasis on street food. Various configurations of oysters and green papaya will take center stage at a table where cooks will shuck the bivalves and assemble the salads. Along with the now-inevitable smashed cucumbers will be green curry with heritage goat, and smoked trout with betel leaf. They also plan to install beehives on their roof and use local honey in cocktails. (October): 252 Broome Street (Ludlow Street).\n\nMaman Tribeca Building on the success of their first Maman cafe in SoHo, Armand Arnal, Benjamin Sormonte and Elisa Marshall will open a larger version, with more emphasis on dining in than on takeout, with wine and cocktails. Their focus will remain the alluring home cooking they know from the south of France. (November): 211 West Broadway (Franklin Street).\n\nQuality Eats First there was Quality Meats, then Quality Italian, both uptown. Now, Michael Stillman and Fourth Wall Restaurants will open this downtown steakhouse with a casual feel and the chef Craig Koketsu’s inventive alternatives to the usual rib-eye and filet mignon. (November): 19 Greenwich Avenue (10th Street).\n\nRosa Mexicano A TriBeCa edition of this group of Mexican restaurants will combine an upstairs dining room with a lower level bar, Masa y Agave, serving tacos and snacks with agave-based spirits. (November): 41 Murray Street (West Broadway).\n\n\nMelissa Weller, formerly a baker at Per Se and Roberta’s, will indulge her pursuit of the ideal bagel at Sadelle’s.\nPABLO ENRIQUEZ FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES\nSadelle’s The protean Major Food Group (Carbone, Dirty French) is out to make a destination of the humble bagel with a schmear. This dressy bakery/appetizing counter/restaurant has soaring ceilings, brick walls, brass trim and seating for 100 on three levels. Rising in the center is a glassed-in bagel bakery that looks like a subway elevator, where Melissa Weller, formerly a baker at Per Se and Roberta’s, will indulge her pursuit of the ideal bagel. Also on the menu, and sold at the retail counter in front, are challah, babkas, sticky buns, cookies, Danish and various breads. In the evening that area will become a raw bar with caviar service. (Monday): 463 West Broadway (Houston Street).\n\nSpeedy Romeo The Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, original is known for its wood-fired grill and pizza oven, both of which will be replicated at this branch on the Lower East Side. (December): 63 Clinton Street (Houston Street).\n\nTacombi The group that owns Café El Presidente, Fonda Nolita and La Brisa in Montauk, N.Y., is unifying its image and relabeling them all Tacombi, including this, their latest, also Mexican, in the West Village. (September): 255 Bleecker Street (Cornelia Street).\n\nYunnan BBQ Erika Chou and Doron Wong will specialize in Chinese barbecue, family style, in this makeover of their Yunnan Kitchen. They’ll roast ducks, chickens, heritage meats and even whole fish. (September): 79 Clinton Street (Stanton Street).\n\nUp to 60th Street\n\nBedford & Co. For the chef John DeLucie, whose portfolio has been trimmed down to just Bills Food & Drink, this will be his first venture without partners. He will make modern comfort food, some of it produced on a wood-burning grill (de rigueur equipment this year) in an art-themed hotel that was favored by 20th-century writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald. (November): The Renwick, 118 East 40th Street.\n\n\nBlack Barn What began as a face-lift for the space that had been Tony May’s restaurant SD26 has turned into a major overhaul. John Doherty, who left his post as executive chef at the Waldorf Astoria in 2009, teamed up with Mark Zeff, a designer whose architectural firm is building houses in the Hamptons under the name Black Barn. Mr. Zeff’s style, at once rustic and sleekly modern, is being translated to the restaurant. They’ve opened up the entrance to the sprawling space, doubled the ceiling height and added barnlike crossbeams, smoothly finished barn siding and some industrial details. Mr. Doherty, who has retained Mr. May’s chef, Matteo Bergamini, plans a relaxed new-American menu of grilled items, slow-cooked specialties and plates for sharing. At the front will be an oyster and Champagne bar. (September): 19 East 26th Street.\n\nBottle & Bine New-American dishes with global accents will come from three partners: Angie Berry, who was the chef de cuisine at Asiate; Gina Goyette, the former sommelier at the Dutch; and Carolyn Pincus, the beer curator at Stag’s Head. (October): 1085 Second Avenue (57th Street).\n\nCara The owners of Angel, in Harlem, head to Midtown with a casual restaurant and bar. Will the main draw be the crispy braised pork belly with bourbon-maple barbecue glaze, or the apple pie in a jar with caramel sauce and a gingerbread crust, or the 21 TV screens? (September): 7 East 36th Street.\n\nChelsea Creamline Ronnybrook Farm Dairy has closed its milk bar and retail shop in Chelsea Market and is turning it into a casual restaurant serving comfort food. The space will retain its rural barn-board look and a retail counter for dairy products. The menu, by the chef Harris Mayer-Selinger, will feature corn dogs, cheeseburgers, fried chicken and biscuits, and soda fountain specialties. Ingredients will come from local farms and Dickson’s Farmstand Meats, next door in the market. (Sept. 16): 75 Ninth Avenue (15th Street),\n\nDos Caminos An outpost of this popular chain, with a tequila and mezcal bar, is coming to Times Square. The chef, Ivy Stark, promises a lighter menu. (Thursday): W New York Times Square, 1567 Broadway (47th Street).\n\nIndian Accent Manish Mehrotra, the executive chef of the Indian Accent restaurant in New Delhi, is bringing what he says is a much-needed fresh look at Indian cuisine to New York. “The Indian food you have here is traditional and not as evolved as in India,” he said. Pork ribs, crispy red snapper with caviar, soft-shell crabs imported from Southern India and bacon bread are some of the dishes he plans to serve in an understated contemporary setting, formerly Seppi’s. The restaurant is part of Old World Hospitality, a major Indian group. (November): 123 West 56th Street.\n\nJue Lan Club In Limelight, the former church and nightclub, the restaurateur Stratis Morfogen will open a 275-seat restaurant on two floors (with a shady garden), named for a Chinese art society of the 1930s. The chef, Oscar Toro, who was the executive sous-chef at Buddakan, will indulge some new ideas, including raw bar specialties, along with more traditional lobster, crab and shrimp preparations. The menu will be à la carte, with a tasting menu option and a dim sum brunch with rolling carts. (November): 49 West 20th Street.\n\nLa Chine A Chinese company took over the Waldorf Astoria in February, and now Oscars Brasserie, on the Lexington Avenue side, is being replaced by a serene, ambitious Chinese restaurant. “You’ll find authentic Chinese in Flushing and Chinatown, but not at the high end,” said David Garcelon, the hotel’s culinary director. The menu will include specialties from various regions, including Zhejiang Province, a coastal area south of Shanghai where raw seafood is often served. The kitchen will be headed by Kong Khai Meng, an expert in contemporary Chinese cuisine. The hotel is also bringing in chefs from Beijing and Singapore and has hired Josh Bedell, a raw-fish expert who was at Cherry in the meatpacking district. (October): Waldorf Astoria New York, 540 Lexington Avenue (49th Street).\n\n\nLaurent Tourondel at L’Amico.\nHIROKO MASUIKE / THE NEW YORK TIMES\nL’Amico This Italian-American brasserie-style restaurant from Laurent Tourondel — who already presides at Brasserie Ruhlmann and runs LT Burger in Sag Harbor, N.Y. — has an open kitchen and two wood-burning copper-clad ovens, one of which is dedicated to producing crisp, alluringly charred pizzas (the other will burnish chickens and steaks). He is also creating casual bar food for the Vine, a sprawling lounge area in the adjacent Eventi Hotel that opens onto a spacious outdoor patio with a big movie screen. (Sept. 10): Eventi Hotel, 849 Avenue of the Americas (30th Street).\n\n\nJoe Bastianich, left, and Mario Batali on the construction site of La Sirena.\nTONY CENICOLA / THE NEW YORK TIMES\nLa Sirena Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich are not just opening their first new restaurant in years, in the Maritime Hotel; they’re responsible for all the dining in the hotel. Their showcase will be the big indoor-outdoor 250-seater, a hybrid trattoria. Josh Laurano, a 10-year veteran with the company, is in charge of the kitchen. Mr. Batali plans fried and roasted tidbits, pastas, classics like scaloppine dishes and steaks, and a brunch that evokes Little Italy. “I’m so excited and a little bit nervous,” Mr. Batali said. Mr. Bastianich agreed: “It’s a new world out there, with lots of younger groups coming along.” (November): Maritime Hotel, 88 Ninth Avenue (16th Street).\n\n\nLe Coq Rico Having managed most of the obstacle course that is building and opening a restaurant in New York, Antoine Westermann, an Alsatian chef with three Michelin stars, is almost ready to open his palace of poulet. His partner in the venture is Francis Staub, who owns the Staub cookware company. This is a somewhat larger branch of Mr. Westermann’s restaurant of the same name on the edge of Montmartre in Paris; it comprises two narrow storefronts — one a bar and the other an open kitchen with rotisseries, a plancha and a dining counter — joined by a spacious dining room in the rear. Mr. Westermann and his team are still researching chickens to find an American bird with the flavor of the highly prized French poulet de Bresse. Other birds will be served, as will innards and eggs. (October): 30 East 20th Street.\n\nMomosan Ramen & Sake Masaharu Morimoto is getting into the ramen game, a little late perhaps, but then it’s Mr. Morimoto, which makes it a big deal. Momosan is what his chefs call him, and now you can, too. (October): 342 Lexington Avenue (39th Street).\n\n\nPascaline Lepeltier, the sommelier and a partner, with Andy Bennett outside Rouge Tomate Chelsea.\nSARA KRULWICH / THE NEW YORK TIMES\nRouge Tomate Chelsea A former horse stable is the new downtown home for this restaurant where sustainability and seasonality drive the menu. Whitewashed brick, reclaimed wood and stone will be incorporated into the design by Bentel & Bentel on two floors. A new chef, Andy Bennett, came on board in the former East 60th Street location; the sommelier and partner remains the much-lauded Pascaline Lepeltier. (November): 126 West 18th Street.\n\nSalvation Burger Having established Salvation Taco in the Pod 39 Hotel, a repurposed Salvation Army headquarters, Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield are taking the name north, to the Pod 51 Hotel. Ms. Bloomfield will offer her own burger blend, ground in-house, and variations, including a vegetarian burger, along with homemade potato buns and assorted pies. (October): 230 East 51st Street.\n\n\nApril Bloomfield, left, tests a burger bun recipe with Michelle Petrulio.\nLIZ BARCLAY FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES\nSen Sakana The cooking of Peru has long had a strong Japanese influence. Now that fusion will be expressed in sushi, ceviche, anticuchos and grilled meats from a kitchen run by Mina Newman, whose mother is Peruvian, and the Japanese native Taku Nagai. (November): 28 West 44th Street.\n\nSushi Ginza Onodera A fine Tokyo-based sushi chain with branches in Hong Kong, Paris and Honolulu comes to New York, with a minimalist sushi bar and tables. Fifth Avenue is a fitting location: Ginza is considered the Fifth Avenue of Tokyo. It will serve only omakase. (November): 461 Fifth Avenue (41st Street).\n\nSushi Seki Late-night sushi? Sushi Seki on the Upper East Side has long been a magnet, where you are likely to see chefs refueling. It has a young sibling in Chelsea. And now Seki Shi has taken over what was the two-story Restaurant Row townhouse of Firebird and replaced the Romanoff-era rococo with vertical and horizontal slats of pale wood and plaster walls embedded with bits of rice straw. It will be his multiplex flagship. Bar Seki on the ground floor provides a long marble counter for drinks and casual fare, with a communal table and a chef’s table for kappo-style tasting menus. Upstairs is for sushi, with a sake and whiskey bar, three private tatami rooms and a sushi bar and tables for omakase. Edward Wijaya, from Indonesia, is the executive chef and a partner. (Sept. 21): 365 West 46th Street.\n\nTacuba The chef and restaurateur Julian Medina will create a Hell’s Kitchen satellite of his Astoria, Queens, restaurant that specializes in tacos and seafood. (November): 802 Ninth Avenue (55th Street).\n\nTemerario Mexican street food for up to 120 customers, including seats outdoors, will be served at this latest project from the Jorge Guzman team, which owns Black Ant, Gardënia and Ofrenda. (November): 198 Eighth Avenue (20th Street).\n\nWisefish Poké Drew Crane and Bryan Cowan, lovers of poké, the Hawaiian raw-fish salad specialty, who have seen it become something of a craze on the West Coast, will bring it to New York in fast-casual cafeteria style. Customers can assemble a poké bowl to order. (November): 263 West 19th Street.\n\nAbove 60th Street\n\nCrave Fishbar Todd Mitgang’s relaxed Midtown East haven for seafood, where attention is paid to the local catch and dishes for carnivores are not ignored, will get an Upper West Side sibling. (November): 428 Amsterdam Avenue (80th Street).\n\nEli’s Tap Eli Zabar’s grab-and-go food shops, Eli’s Essentials, are starting to blanket the Upper East Side. Unlike the one at 91st Street, which becomes a wine bar at night, the latest will morph in the evening into a beer pub with 10 taps and a modest wine list. Mussels, oysters and sandwiches dominate the menu. (October): 189 East 79th Street.\n\nMaison Hugo It has taken Florian Victor Hugo and his wife, Michelle, several years, but this descendant of the novelist is finally poised to welcome customers at what he calls a “brasserie moderne.” He will serve traditional fare and rotisserie meats in a streamlined setting, while she will manage the two dining rooms. (September): 132 East 61st Street.\n\nService Station Fill ’er up. Giulio Adriani, the pizza master known for his montanaro deep-fried pie at Forcella, will sling that style and others in a former Mobil station with 160 seats and a sprawling outdoor area. (September): 500 York Avenue (61st Street).\n\nBrooklyn\n\nFredrik Berselius A name has not been chosen for Mr. Berselius’s follow-up to Aska, which drew a Michelin star before closing last year. The risk-taking Swedish chef will continue to tap his Nordic roots with a tasting menu, and serve drinks and “snacky things” in a lower-level bar. “We’ll work with farmers but do preserving, smoking, fermenting, drying and age our meats and hang our birds,” he said. The setting combines the rough and the polished, with an open kitchen, a small backyard and reservations. The name will not be Aska, Mr. Berselius said: “This is a new chapter.” (November): 47 South Fifth Street (Wythe Avenue), Williamsburg.\n\nBlack Tree Brooklyn A spinoff of a Lower East Side farm-to-table spot where the menu changes weekly, this has more space and a chef’s table with a tasting menu. (October): 261 Metropolitan Avenue (Driggs Avenue), Williamsburg.\n\nCarla Hall’s Southern Kitchen Ms. Hall, the television chef, will turn the former Whiskey Soda Lounge into a fast-casual source for Nashville hot chicken and other comfort foods. She and her partner, Evan Darnell, promise down-home authenticity. On Sept. 21, they will open a big kiosk for crispy grilled chicken sandwiches in the Barclays Center. (September): 115 Columbia Street (Kane Street), Columbia Street Waterfront District.\n\nChuko Bushwick An offspring of Chuko Ramen in Prospect Heights, with a full liquor license, will come to busy Bushwick, where the restaurant scene is expanding by the minute. (October): 144 Evergreen Avenue (Jefferson Street), Bushwick.\n\nEl Atoradero Brooklyn The Mexican chef Denisse Lina Chavez drew rave reviews for her cramped cubbyhole in the Bronx until a rent increase prompted its closing this summer and a hunt for a larger footprint. “I would have preferred Manhattan, but it was too expensive,” Ms. Chavez said. “Besides, 90 percent of my customers come from Brooklyn.” She will have about 50 seats, a bar and a small garden in which to serve her home-style Poblano cooking. She will keep her small Bronx bodega. (October): 708 Washington Avenue (Prospect Place), Prospect Heights.\n\nKimoto Rooftop Beer Garden Andrew Lee and Brian Tsao, who own Mira Sushi & Izakaya in Manhattan, will serve Japanese craft brews and whimsical bar food like Shibuya disco fries, named for a Tokyo neighborhood and loaded with enough ingredients (beef brisket, garlic sour cream, sriracha) to make Canadian poutine seem austere. (Sept. 17): 216 Duffield Street (Willoughby Street), downtown Brooklyn.\n\nLe Garage Catherine Allswang owned restaurants in Paris that graced French dishes with accents from other cuisines. She will recreate the style here; likely menu items include skate in black butter, pork cheek confit with roasted celeriac, and fig pie with mascarpone and pepper. Her daughter, Rachel, has designed the relaxed restaurant and will manage it. (September): 159B Central Avenue (Suydam Street), Bushwick.\n\nLilia The chef Missy Robbins, who has been doing consulting since she left A Voce, has joined with Matt Kliegman of the Smile and Black Seed Bagels. Her food, in the Italian idiom, will not be shy: cacio e pepe fritelle; rigatoni diavola with tomatoes, chiles and pecorino; and wood-grilled swordfish with sweet and hot peppers. There will be outdoor seating, a small area for takeaway and a dining room of pale wood and tile, flooded with natural light. (September): 567 Union Ave. (North 10th Street), Williamsburg.\n\nLlama Inn High-end Peruvian has had an uneven record in New York, but Raymi, in the Flatiron district, is still going strong. Erik Ramirez, who was the executive chef, plans to hew to a farm-to-table approach as much as possible (though some of the farms may be on terraces in the Urubamba Valley). In the planning are red snapper with dried Andean potatoes, beef stir-fry that’s a take on lomo saltado, and grilled veal heart. Expect the pisco to flow. (October): 50 Withers Street (Lorimer Street), Williamsburg.\n\nMaman Brooklyn The SoHo original is branching out this fall not only to TriBeCa but also to Greenpoint, where a larger dining room will greet those with a yen for home cooking from southern France. (November): 80 Kent Street (Franklin Street), Greenpoint.\n\nPipsqueak Chicago-style deep-dish pizza is the specialty, from the group that owns the adjacent Tutu’s, a neighborhood spot for comfort food. (November): 252 Varet Street (Bogart Street), Bushwick.\n\nSauvage Krystof Zizka and Joshua Boissy of Maison Premiere are opening a 95-seat restaurant and outdoor cafe opposite McCarren Park. Lisa Giffen, the chef and a partner, worked at Blue Hill, Daniel and Adour Alain Ducasse. The drinks menu will emphasize French, organic and natural wines, and wine-based cocktails. (November): 905 Lorimer Street (Nassau Avenue), Williamsburg.\n\nSushi Ganso In a radius of just a few blocks, Harris Salat and Tadashi Ono have dished out all sorts of Japanese cooking over the last few years: first ramen, then yaki grilling, and now sushi, at 30 seats next door to Ganso Yaki. Let’s hope they decide to take on tempura next. (October): 31 Third Avenue (Atlantic Avenue), Boerum Hill.\n\nQueens\n\nBierocracy The inventory at this fairly traditional beer hall with a long bar, communal tables and room for 400 guzzlers will consist of local craft beers and imports from Central Europe, many on tap. Classic brew food like pretzels and sausages will share the menu with knishes, pulled pork on biscuits, beer-battered lobster tails on baguettes and European fruit dumplings. (October): 12-23 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\nRestaurant Debuts That Stand Out Above the Rest SEP 8, 2015\nIn New Restaurants, the Faces Are Increasingly Female SEP 8, 2015\nPile High the Chicken and Biscuits SEP 8, 2015\nRaw Fish Finds a Spot on Chinese Menus SEP 8, 2015\nJapanese Restaurants Focus on Specialties SEP 8, 2015\nMost Popular on NYTimes.com\n\nKim Davis, Released From Kentucky Jail, Won’t Say if She Will Keep Defying Court\n\nUnited C.E.O.

(Con todos los respetos de los madrileños que nos leen… ¡La tierra es la tierra!).\n\nHoy compartimos con vosotros 7 tabernas andaluzas en Madrid para sentiros como en casa, sitios donde la cultura del tapeito está a la orden del día, lugares donde podéis hacer más real la sensación de “Comer en Cádiz“.¡Tomad nota!\n\n1. Taberna gaditana La Caleta\n\nEntre Antón Martín y Lavapiés, en la calle Tres Peces 21, nos encontramos con La Caleta madrileña, una taberna gaditana para comer en papelones las cositas buenas de Cádiz. Uno de los mejores sitios para recordar el arte culinario del sur sin salir de Madrid, uno de los referentes de la gastronomía andaluza en la capital. Recomendamos el cartuchito de bienmesabe para disfrutarlo con una buena copa de vino de la tierra y un poco de flamenco en la taberna La Caleta.\n\nTaberna_La_Caleta_Madrid\n\n2. Abacería y Bar Lambuzo\n\nEn la calle de las Conchas 9 (Centro) o en la Calle Ponzano 8 (Chamberí), se encuentra la Abacería y Bar Lambuzo, un trocito de Andalucía y Cádiz en Madrid con toque vintage que nos mola mucho. Un bar de tapas familiar donde la gastronomía más típica de Cádiz y buenos vinos de nuestra tierra conviven con algunos innovaciones en la carta. Buenos precios, buena gente y buena materia prima es la mezcla que propone Lambuzo y que encanta a los comensales que pasan por sus mesas. Podéis encontrar de todo, croquetas de todos los estilos (De tortillitas de camarones, de gambas al ajillo…), pescaito frito, papas aliñás o quesos y chacinas gaditanos. Entre otras cosas os recomendamos que no se os pase hincarle el diente a la hamburguesa de rabo de toro o la hamburguesa de cabracho y langostinos. Si hiceramos una lista de los mejores bares andaluces en Madrid, este estaría entre ellos.\n\nLambuzo_Madrid\n\n3. Taberna Sanlúcar\n\nEn la calle San Isidro Labrador 14 nos encontramos con una trocito de Sanlúcar en Madrid. Sólo con ver la fachada verde, las paredes en color albero y la decoración con carteles taurinos o fotos de cantaores da la sensación de estar en Andalucía. En la Taberna Sanlúcar podemos encontrar recetas típicas sanluqueñas y de las localidades gaditanas más próximas. Recomendamos las huevas de merluza aliñas, los Huevos de Sanlúcar, las Papas con chocos o los Garbanzos con espinacas. Todo ello, como no, acompañado con manzanilla de Sanlúcar. Es un bar andaluz en Madrid con solera, desde 2002.\n\nTaberna_Sanlucar_Madrid\n\n4. Taberna La Gaditana\n\nEn el barrio de Salamanca, calle Lombia 6, está Taberna La Gaditana, un espacio típico andaluz, otro rincón de Cádiz en pleno centro de la capital. Entre otros platos, podréis disfrutar de ortiguillas, tortillitas de camarones, cazón, atún rojo y todo tipo de frituras. También cuentan con un restaurante en la calle Fuente del Berro 23, a sólo unos pasos de la taberna.\n\nTaberna_Gaditana_Madrid\n\n5. Taberna Casa Curro\n\nEn la Cava Baja 23, La Latina, nos encontramos con Taberna Casa Curro, un taberna son “sabor a Caí”. Un lugar que todos los gaditanos deberíamos visitar alguna vez en Madrid. Amplia variedad de productos gaditanos que predominan en toda la carta. Junto a la carne mechá o los chicharrones en papelito de estraza podemos saborear el rico Moscatel Gloria.\n\nTaberna_Casa_Curro_Madrid\n\n6. Taberna Bienmesabe\n\nTambién incluimos dentro de las 7 tabernas gaditanas en Madrid para sentirte como en casa a Taberna Bienmesabe. Si quereis probar la gastronomía de este establecimiento lo podéis hacer en: Calle General Arranda 26 (Chamberí), Gabriel Lobo 33 (Cruz del Rayo), General López Pozas 8 (Chamartín). Igual que en el resto de tabernas, podéis encontrar un poco de todo, fritura, marisco o pescado. Podéis decidir comer en barra o en mesa, siempre un pelín más caro.\n\nTaberna_BienMesabe_Madrid\n\n7. Restaurante mediterráneo Surtopía\n\nEn la calle Nuñez de Balboa 106, Barrio de Salamaca, el gaditano Jesús Calleja nos abre las puertas de Surtopía, un establecimiento diferente a los anteriores, no es realmente una taberna, es un restaurante, pero donde igualmente encontramos cocina gaditana y andaluza para disfrutar en mesa o en barra. Quizás uno de los mejores restaurante andaluces en Madrid. Tenéis donde elegir, fritura, carne o pescado, hay de todo. Destacamos la amplia variedad en productos de Barbate, si os apetece atún, este es el sitio ideal."

"Restaurants","Indonesian","Rave\nIndonesian food has been a personal favorite ever since I discovered it in Holland as a teenager. It’s richer than Vietnamese, more subtle than Malaysian, and—at least in Atlanta—far less sweet than Thai. Our two surviving standouts, Batavia and Tempo Doeloe, are around the corner from one another in Chamblee. Both are good—Tempo Doeloe’s lamb satay over rice cakes and its shaved ice dessert are musts—and both stock steam tables where $7 gets you two proteins, one veggie, and rice. Still, you’ll find me at Batavia more often.\n\nThere, young goat stew (the menu calls it lamb) in coconut milk, peeled shrimp in a creamy tomato gravy, and snacks of shrimp fritters or tofu with fried anchovies and peanuts are good introductions for the uninitiated. Bolder appetites will dig the tendons, gizzards, and anything prepared with belacan (a pungent shrimp paste). Always ask for extra house sambal, a condiment made with chile peppers that’s the pride and glory of any Indonesian kitchen.\n\n- See more at: http://www.atlantamagazine.com/dining-news/the-christiane-chronicles-stop-underappreciating-atlanta-chefs-and-2-standout-indonesian-spots/#sthash.FheuXmKr.dpuf"

Urp. For a deft, deep survey of the freshest local bounty (with one of the nation’s jaw-dropping wine collections), no place can touch the floridly decorated farmstead in Woodinville wine country. Every Northwesterner must visit at least once—either in foodie fall, when summer meets harvest meets mushroom rains meets seafood runs, or when whatever big anniversary or dividend check justifies the expenditure required to do it right. Meaning: Spend the night. The boutique Willows Inn is just stumbling distance across the courtyard. Cryin’ shame if you were the designated driver when owner Ron Zimmerman broke out the 1795 Madeira.

"Restaurants","Dan Kluger","The renaissance of Eighth Street continues with this unnamed entry from Mr. Kluger, the former chef at Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s ABC Kitchen and ABC Cocina. He has taken over a former barbecue place, with 110 seats, a bar area, private rooms and a wood-burning oven and grill. His seasonal American fare will be heavy on vegetables, but don’t expect those delicious roasted carrots with avocado that everyone else has copied. “I’ll do something different with carrots,” he said. (December): 21-23 West Eighth Street."
"Restaurants","Quality Eats","First there was Quality Meats, then Quality Italian, both uptown. Now, Michael Stillman and Fourth Wall Restaurants will open this downtown steakhouse with a casual feel and the chef Craig Koketsu’s inventive alternatives to the usual rib-eye and filet mignon. (November): 19 Greenwich Avenue (10th Street)."
"Restaurants","Cara","The owners of Angel, in Harlem, head to Midtown with a casual restaurant and bar. Will the main draw be the crispy braised pork belly with bourbon-maple barbecue glaze, or the apple pie in a jar with caramel sauce and a gingerbread crust, or the 21 TV screens? (September): 7 East 36th Street."
"Restaurants","Café Altro Paradiso","The chef Ignacio Mattos and his partner, Thomas Carter, who own the independent-minded small plate walk-up Estela, will now go Italian in a bright, airy space. They envision a more traditional menu, divided into starters, pastas, mains and desserts; they will do breakfast, lunch and dinner. (December): 234 Spring Street (Avenue of the Americas)."
"Restaurants","Bruno pizza","New pizza place"
"Restaurants","Black Barn","What began as a face-lift for the space that had been Tony May’s restaurant SD26 has turned into a major overhaul. John Doherty, who left his post as executive chef at the Waldorf Astoria in 2009, teamed up with Mark Zeff, a designer whose architectural firm is building houses in the Hamptons under the name Black Barn. Mr. Zeff’s style, at once rustic and sleekly modern, is being translated to the restaurant. They’ve opened up the entrance to the sprawling space, doubled the ceiling height and added barnlike crossbeams, smoothly finished barn siding and some industrial details. Mr. Doherty, who has retained Mr. May’s chef, Matteo Bergamini, plans a relaxed new-American menu of grilled items, slow-cooked specialties and plates for sharing. At the front will be an oyster and Champagne bar. (September): 19 East 26th Street."
"Restaurants","Harold’s Meat & Three"," No longer able to hang his toque at Commerce, which closed, Harold Moore has lined up a hotel gig, delivering comfort food in the Southern tradition: meat and three sides. (December): Tommie Hudson Square, 231 Hudson Street (Broome Street)."

"Restaurants","Sadelle’s","Sadelle’s The protean Major Food Group (Carbone, Dirty French) is out to make a destination of the humble bagel with a schmear. This dressy bakery/appetizing counter/restaurant has soaring ceilings, brick walls, brass trim and seating for 100 on three levels. Rising in the center is a glassed-in bagel bakery that looks like a subway elevator, where Melissa Weller, formerly a baker at Per Se and Roberta’s, will indulge her pursuit of the ideal bagel. Also on the menu, and sold at the retail counter in front, are challah, babkas, sticky buns, cookies, Danish and various breads. In the evening that area will become a raw bar with caviar service. (Monday): 463 West Broadway (Houston Street)."
"Restaurants","High Street on Hudson","Check your fear of carbs at the door and succumb to the breads that will emerge from an on-premises bakery run by Alex Bois, who has yet to meet a grain he doesn’t like. He is also proud of his classic and inventive bagels. Eli Kulp, the co-owner with Ellen Yin, put in time at Torrisi Italian Specialties, then went to Philadelphia, where he joined Ms. Yin at Fork; then they opened High Street on Market. Here, they’ll embrace vegetables and incorporate breads in many dishes. (November): 637 Hudson Street (Horatio Street)."
"Restaurants","L’Amico","This Italian-American brasserie-style restaurant from Laurent Tourondel — who already presides at Brasserie Ruhlmann and runs LT Burger in Sag Harbor, N.Y. — has an open kitchen and two wood-burning copper-clad ovens, one of which is dedicated to producing crisp, alluringly charred pizzas (the other will burnish chickens and steaks). He is also creating casual bar food for the Vine, a sprawling lounge area in the adjacent Eventi Hotel that opens onto a spacious outdoor patio with a big movie screen. (Sept. 10): Eventi Hotel, 849 Avenue of the Americas (30th Street)."
"Restaurants","Il Bambino","This branch of a panini shop in Astoria, Queens, owned by Sava Tsitiridis, Theo Mavromilhalis and the chef Darren Lawless will offer brunch instead of supper after 10:30 p.m. on weekends. (September): 48 West Eighth Street."
"Restaurants","Lucky Bee","Matty Bennett, who was the chef at Fat Radish on the Lower East Side and Longrain in Sydney, Australia, and Rupert Noffs, his Australian partner, are opening what they call a Southeast Asian farm-to-table restaurant with an emphasis on street food. Various configurations of oysters and green papaya will take center stage at a table where cooks will shuck the bivalves and assemble the salads. Along with the now-inevitable smashed cucumbers will be green curry with heritage goat, and smoked trout with betel leaf. They also plan to install beehives on their roof and use local honey in cocktails. (October): 252 Broome Street (Ludlow Street)."

"Restaurants","Top Hog BBQ - Gallatin, TN","The best cheeseburger you will ever eat!!"
"Restaurants","Thank God Donuts - Hendersonville, TN","Brea: Yes, I'm sharing my secret. This little gem has best glazed croissant thingys I've EVER put in my mouth. They are like crack. The owners are precious. It doesn't look like a high class joint, but their health food scores are top notch and the donuts are A+. Get there early, they sell out fast."
"Restaurants","The Perfect Pig Café & Gourmet Market - Seagrove / Santa Rosa Beach, FL","Brea LOVES this place, but has only done breakfast there. The service is a little slow, but the food is heavenly."
"Restaurants","Urban Grub - Nashville, TN","Brea: Perfect date night spot! We {heart} it! Located in 12th South area, we've never had a bad meal there… But you HAVE to make reservations. Otherwise you will wait 2 hours for a table. You can eat at the bar, but that's usually pretty crowded as well. It's so, so, so good. Just go eat there, trust me!"
"Restaurants","Garden Brunch Café - Nashville, TN","Bananas Foster Pancakes"
"Restaurants","The Pfunky Griddle - Nashville, TN","Make your own pancakes right there at your table!"
"Restaurants","Calumet Fisheries","East Side\n“If you’ve seen The Blues Brothers, you’ve seen this shrimp shack that’s also one of the last surviving slices of steel-mill Chicago. Fried shrimp and smelts are good, but the smoked chubs from the on-site smokehouse are fantastic. Buy a bag, eat off the hood of your car while watching the barges go by, and enjoy food like a blue collar man for once.” – Mike"
"Restaurants","Bom Bolla (Spanish tapa & wine bar)","The Spanish wine bar with a punk rock vibe from the Pops For Champagne people is best-known for its cava, but don't overlook the food, most notably the bocadillos (Spanish sandwiches). Six sections of the menu run from bar bites (olives, cheese) to larger plates, in trying to emulate traditional dining in Spain."
"Restaurants","Zacataco's","West Lawn, Multiple Locations\n“You can’t smell the stockyards on the South Side any more, thank God, but you can smell steak sizzling a half-mile away at any location of this South Side taco chain. The menu is short, but everything they do, they do damn near perfectly: juicy greasy steak, tart al pastor, and crispy tacos stuffed with mashed potatoes. [It's] as insanely comfy as a TV dinner.” -Mike"
"Restaurants","C Chicago (nice seafood)","The guys behind Chicago Cut have brought steakhouse style to a seafood restaurant. Choose from a pricey daily selection of fish displayed on ice, a massive wine list you browse with an iPad, and a pretty interior in River North."
"Restaurants","Garifuna Flava (Caribbean)","Chicago Lawn\n“The South Side spot has countless Caribbean eating options, but most of them tend to be Jamaican. Garifuna Flava is named after the food of the Garifuna people who are direct descendants of Carib, Arawak, and West African people who settled in Central America. Sample one of the world’s rarer cuisines -- the soups are where they really shine -- while enjoying a drink at the bar.” -Titus"
"Restaurants","Pub Royale","The new Anglo-Indian bar from the guys behind Trenchermen and Sportsman's Club has a sterling selection of beer and cocktails, but the cheffy bar food takes on Indian fare is becoming just as big of a draw on Division Street."
"Restaurants","Lem's BBQ House","Greater Grand Crossing\n“Lem’s is the oldest barbecue joint in town, circa 1946, and still presided over by James Lemons, last survivor of Three Barbecuing Brothers. It packs them in every night for ribs, rib tips and chicken wings. Quality can vary depending on who’s working the pit, but when the ribs and tips are good, they’re ‘thank you Jesus’ good.” -Mike"
"Restaurants","Boeufhaus","Boeufhaus may have been one of the most secretive openings in recent memory, but the creative, refined meat-centric brasserie-style food with French and German influences, forthcoming lunch counter, and neighborhood vibe means it shouldn't stay a secret for long."
"Restaurants","Jimmy Jamm's Sweet Potato Pies","Beverly\n“Namesake Jimmy Ferguson has been making sweet potato pies almost since she was a baby. Taught by her daddy, she and her husband (along with their nephew) decided to open a pie shop with the recipe in her Grandfather's honor. But that's not all they do here. The menu features everything from baked-and-loaded sweet potatoes, to dessert favorites like cobbler and bread pudding. Everything on [the menu] has some sweet potato in the ingredients.” -Titus"
"Restaurants","Birriera Zaragoza (Mexican)","Archer Heights\n“The nicest Mexican family in town makes some of the best soul-filling food in the city: spicy yet comfy birria -- aka slow-roasted goat stew -- which you pile onto tender, house-made tortillas hot off the grill and spice to center-of-a-volcano levels with house-made salsa or straight-up crumpled chiles.” -Mike"
"Restaurants","DeQuay","Chef/owner David De Quay's recently-opened Lincoln Park restaurant is one of the only spots in town to offer Dutch-Indonesian dishes in a refined setting near DePaul."

"Restaurants","More Than a Feeling","Not so long ago, restaurants were run mostly by intuition and experience. You’d put together a menu you thought would work. You’d serve the customers and hope they liked it. You’d estimate how many waiters and dishwashers you needed and hope you'd scheduled enough—but not too many. Usually, any changes you made to improve your business were based on either crises that erupted or hunches—intuitions—that you had. Really, you were just guessing based on your experiences and hoping for the best. \nhttp://www.fsrmagazine.com/kitchen-sink/more-feeling"

"Restaurants","Boiling Crab","Someone had the brilliant idea to go to Boiling Crab to watch Game 6 of the NBA Playoffs between the Cavs and the Warriors. I'm so glad you did because this was definitely one of the best meals I've had in a while. \n\nIt lived up to all of the hype, and the experience was so much better because you were right there next to me. Teaching me how to eat crawfish properly and how to crack their tricky shells. You also showed me how to ""efficiently"" peel off the shrimp shells. \n\nWe came huuuuungry because between me, you, Zeng, and Chai, we finished a basket of cajun fries, an order of fried catfish with lemon pepper fries, 6 oysters, 1 lb. of clams, 2 lbs. of crawfish, and 2 lbs. of shrimp all done ""mild with the whole sha bang!"" \n\nThanks for being our Boiling Crab guide babe. It really means a lot to me that you wanted to spend time with me and my cousins. I love you!"
"Restaurants","Taiko","We had to wait for at least 40 mins for a table, but when we finally got seated, it was all worth it. \n\nI had the scallop tempura and you had the salmon teriyaki. If we ever want to look back and pinpoint the time we started getting fat… This would be it!\n\nYou were soooo hungry that you kept picking at your salmon, while also eating my scallops! >:( \n\nI'm glad you enjoyed dinner here. Next time, we'll be sure to go before the dinner rush!\n\nLove you, Eileen! ^__^"
"Restaurants","Pieology","Someone was craving pizza on this particular day (Eileen �) so we decided to have some pieology! \n\nKevin was also hungry so we invited him to join us and he was hesitant because he didn't want to come if we wanted to go alone, but you didn't mind and neither did I! � \n\nI have no idea what you made here, but it was F'IN AMAZING!! From now on, you're ordering the pizzas at build-your-own places okay babe? � \n\nCheck the photos to see how you and Kevin both love trolling me -_-\n\nP.s.  you looked really cute in your grey jeggings and Nike sweater! �"
"Restaurants","Earthen Restaurant","Earthen Restaurant was the perfect dinner after a long day of running around from LA to Santa Monica and then back to your area. Babe, I'm just gonna say it now. I trust your food choices, and I am down to eat anything that you tell me you like and that you think I'd like. Everything you ordered here was the bomb.com!!! :D Love you, and I am so glad and I feel so special to have dined at one of your favorite restaurants, eating all your favorite dishes with the one and only Miss Eileen Li Lan Lee. :* <3"
"Restaurants","Blu Jam Cafe","This was the first stop on our August 1, day date, and you were so excited to try this place, I couldn't help be get excited too :) \n\nOh yeah, this was also where you wore dress #1, which you looked beautiful in btw. We got the smoked salmon eggs benedict (it tasted a little…. fishy XP) and the crunchy french toast. Man… that french toast got us both pretty good though. The way they got it to be so crispy and delicious on the outside and still soft and moist on the inside is beyond me. Their ""half and half"" sauce for the toast was amazing as well. I would definitely come back here just to have those french toasts again. What do ya say cutie? \n\nContinue to NHM for part 2 of our August 1, day date…"
"Restaurants","Mama Lu Dumpling House","After showing up a little later than planned, we were told we'd have at least a 30 min wait. All of us were hungry and getting unruly due to the hunger, so we decide to walk around back to satisfy our hunger with some fried meet dumpling balls?!?! \n\nWhatever they were, they were delicious! \n\nRaymond, Kenny, and I all walked back to check on our table, and we showed up just in time because they were about to give our table away. Once we were finally seated, Kenny started ordering the food, and I remember thinking ""Holy crap… this is gonna be one of those meals where we all gain 10lbs…."" It was so worth it though. \n\nBut of course, you know that we can't have dinner with your friends without having dessert as well! See Waffles de Leige."

"Restaurants","Good Bar (Pioneer)","The new project backed by the Marination team.\n\nBut Good Bar is one to anticipate, and not just for its vintage good looks. \n\nFood diverges from the Marination playbook (not a kalua pork taco in sight), cocktails will trend classic, beers local, and meats and vegetables slow roasted. \n\nCheese and charcuterie come by the ounce."
"Restaurants","Alstadt (Pioneer)","Think Bierstube: brick walls, bar stools, brats (terrific), beers (even better), and braised sauerkraut to make a fan of any hater (why thank you, duck fat!). \n\nEven the pretzels are brezels—dense, pillowy, and freakishly exquisite with hot, sweet housemade mustard."
"Restaurants","Quality Athletics (Pioneer)","The latest project of the prolific Josh Henderson (Skillet, Westward)\n\nBut how could we leave out a 3,500-square-foot joint with a wood-fired grill, rooftop garden, and two outdoor fire pits?"
"Restaurants","Damn the Weather (Pioneer)","Connoisseur fare for diners (beef heart tartare, fried squash blossom) vies for prominence with cocktails in this dim and brick-lined bar, roaring with loud professionals. \n\nFood wins by a nose, thanks to more than just novelties, like a Caesar sandwich and a carbonara with zucchini ribbons in lieu of pasta."

Das Thema ""Fliegen"" ist sehr schön umgesetzt: Das freundliche ""Flugpersonal"" trägt Uniformen, man sitzt unter einer Illjuschin 14 auf echten Flugzeugsitzen und hat Aussicht auf die startenden und landenden Maschinen auf der Piste draussen. \nAuch das Essen war sehr gut. Wir hatten Bananensuppe, Krappen-Küchlein, feines Tartar, Rindshuft mit Knoblauch-Kartoffelstock, Datteln und eine Crema Catalana.\nEs war ein sehr schöner Abend."
"Restaurants","IKEA Lyssach","Apfelkuchen gut. Carpaccio gut. Aber die Milch war ganz ganz grausig."
"Restaurants","Vordere Schmiedenmatt","Schlechter Service und Essen. Langsam. Grausiges WC ohne Papier."
"Restaurants","Miagi Langenthal","Freundlicher Service. Das Essen hat nicht überzeugt, nett, aber der letzte Schlif fehlt. Ausgezeichneter tuna und Papaya Salat. Hot rolls nicht schlecht. Sushi Teller unausgewogen. Schreckliche wasabi und Ginger Glacé. Guter alkoholfreier Cocktail, auch anderes Getränk auf Ginger jasmin Basis "
"Restaurants","El Mosquito","Sehr schön eingerichtet. Freundlicher Service. Vorspeisenteller mit je 2 Sachen von allem. Hauptspeise mit Müsterli von allem. hat sehr überzeugt.\nMit Hunden körbli unter den Sitzen. Sie waren ruhig."
"Restaurants","Buffalo Grill Lausanne","Menu promotion 38 Fr.: gutes Entrecôte, eher schlechte Frites, guter Salat Gute Coupe red fruits. Das normale Entrecôte war ziemlich gädrig, auch mit scharfem Messer nicht schneidbar, Rösti war gut, Saucen ausgezeichnet vor allem die kleinen Kräuterbutter. Lieber das Rindsfilet. Hunde kriegten nichts.\n\nVorspeisenteller mit je 2 Stücken zuwenig. Danach hatte ich die assiette texane, mit gutem chili con carne, spare ribs und chickenwings, dazu eine nette Kartoffel. Natalie hatte ein rohes, schlechtes Rindstartar, schmeckte nach nichts. Alles wirkte aufgewärmt mit Kruste obendrauf. Wahrscheinlich Mikrowelle, da sie uns schon nach einigen Minuten nach der Öffnung das Essen servierten, was ja so nicht möglich wäre, wenn es frisch wäre. Das Apple crumble-Dessert war fein, wie gebrannte Créme aber mit Apfelmus unter der Kruste. 1 Walnussglacée-Kugel drauf, was aber zuwenig ist, da es sehr mastig ist.\n\n"
"Restaurants","Tenmanya Laufenburg","Reservieren nicht vergessen! 17.5 € all you can eat. Mit Suppe, Laufbandsachen inkl. Dessert und Sake. Gute alkoholfreie Cocktail (Piña colada). Hunde kann man mitnehmen, sie waren brav. Allesehr gute Qualität. Allerdings war noch nicht alles von anfang an verfügbar, namentlich der Reis. Auch Desserts wie Glacen und tiramisu kamen spät. Rosarote Teigkugeln waren nicht gut. Am Anfang nicht zuviel essen, damit man noch Platz für's Dessert hat."

Their showcase will be the big indoor-outdoor 250-seater, a hybrid trattoria. Josh Laurano, a 10-year veteran with the company, is in charge of the kitchen. Mr. Batali plans fried and roasted tidbits, pastas, classics like scaloppine dishes and steaks, and a brunch that evokes Little Italy. “I’m so excited and a little bit nervous,” Mr. Batali said. Mr. Bastianich agreed: “It’s a new world out there, with lots of younger groups coming along.” (November): Maritime Hotel, 88 Ninth Avenue (16th Street)."

"Restaurants","#Melbourne #Italian #Fine Dining - Grossi Florentino","Grossi Florentino's gravitas crosses generations. That's thanks partly to its history, dating back to the '30s, and partly to the Grossi family (16 years at the helm). Beneath Napier Waller murals of 16th-century Florentine scenes, linen-dressed tables are softly lit and discreetly and intuitively attended to. You even get a purpose-built stool on which to rest your handbag. A vivid green nettle risotto entree is creamy, with lemony pick-ups and an almost gelatinous veil of finely chopped prawn across the surface. It might be followed by light, steamed sweet-fleshed toothfish with peas and warrigal greens. But it's the traditions (priming wine glasses at the table) and the from-another-time formality that make Florentino's an enduring rarefied event.\n80 Bourke Street, Melbourne, 9662 1811"
"Restaurants","#Melbourne #Indian - Kake Di Hatti","This is a seasoned Melbourne favourite famous for its affordability, vibrant atmosphere and zestful flavours. The menu is classic north Indian, with a variety of dahls, masalas and extra-spicy vindaloo. This is the perfect place for a party or gathering of friends, but not so much for a romantic dinner date. What it lacks in intimacy and style it makes up for in speed of service and price. It's worth checking out the specials board but the chicken tikka masala is a safe bet, as is the muttar paneer – homemade cottage cheese and green peas cooked in spicy capsicum and tomato sauce. Finish it off with a kulfi (sweet homemade nut-infused ice cream) and you can walk out full for less than less than $15. Be sure to take advantage of the 99c BYO option; there's a great wine shop across the road.\n\n128 Lygon Street, East Brunswick, open Tues–Sun 5pm–10.30pm. Price $10 to $16."

"Restaurants","#Melbourne #Italian #Fine Dining - Town Hall Hotel","You're looking at whip-smart Italian served in what is every inch a classic boozer. Owner-chef Harry Lilai might greet you in the front bar himself, and advise on the craft beers before disappearing to the kitchen to plate up a deep-fried egg, yolk still runny, with blanched asparagus. Or perhaps a special of char-grilled ox tongue, scattered with golden beets and daubs of peppery herb dressing chased by a grown-up take on the pine-lime Splice. It's sharp and smart stuff, served in a Scandi-slick dining room with attentive service.\n166 Johnston Street, Fitzroy, 9416 5055"
"Restaurants","#Melbourne #Italian #Fine Dining - Scopri","Scopri is old-fashioned in all the best ways: noise is muted even when the room's bustling; lighting flatters but you can still read the menu; and well-drilled waiters, under the direction of co-owners Anthony Scutella and Alison Foley, never call you 'guys'. Chef Andy Logue's menu cherry-picks intriguing regional Italian specialties like silky pappardelle in a ragu of partridge and nebbiolo, bookended by cuttlefish stuffed with lemony bread crumbs and wine-braised baby goat.\n\n191 Nicholson Street, Carlton, 9347 8252"

Pity the carb-hater who will never know what it is to break into Alberto Fava and Andreas Papadakis' perfectly formed tortellini, shiny with browned butter and capturing its parmesan, sage and asparagus heart. Risotto blazes bright with nettles, and offal becomes a meat of the people as ruffles of poached, shaved and grilled ox tongue. Luke Skidmore ties it all together with good chat and exciting wines. Heads down, thumbs up.\n361 Little Bourke Street, Melbourne, 9942 3946"

"Restaurants","#Melbourne #Italian #Casual - Sosta Cucina","The team at this North Melbourne hero not only know how to cook, they know how to eat. Chef Mitch Bodycote's perfect silky linguine with crab, garlic and crisp breadcrumbs is one thing. Waiters ensuring that entrees built for four might get an extra ricotta-stuffed zucchini flower so bigger parties don't have to share is another. It's the little things that make it: fluency in wine, on-point desserts, and enough digestifs to punch a hole through any carb fugue. It's not a bad idea to head straight for the baked swordfish, served in an intensely savoury tomato broth, but the specials, made with whatever Bodycote has scored from the nearby markets, are always where the action is.\n12 Errol Street, Melbourne, 9329 2882"
"Restaurants","#Melbourne #Italian #Casual - Chianti Bistro","Chianti seems like the bistro that 1985 forgot, but the young team who took over the neon-lit venue in 2014 have embraced the retro mood, which now seems fondly ironic rather than naff. Chef and part-owner Domenic Stanton (ex Grossi Florentino, MoVida) is clearly hooked on classics. The tightly scripted menu (around five antipasti, entrees, mains and sides) might offer agro dolce rabbit with broad beans and pancetta in spring, or partner the first pine mushrooms of autumn with soft ricotta and sage, to brilliant effect. Gently remixed desserts such as almond milk panna cotta keep the good times rolling.  \n376 Queens Parade, Fitzroy North, 9481 4628"

You come to Bottega to observe the bustle of Bourke from the city's comfiest ribbed banquettes, also for some of the best pre-theatre deals on the block (three courses for $55 is a bargain when the service, linens and twinkling glassware are all part of the deal). It might be discs of wagyu carpaccio dolloped with black garlic aioli and pickled button mushrooms, or perhaps some slow-cooked salmon, flavoured with mint and maple syrup.\n\n74 Bourke Street, Melbourne, 9654 2252"

"Restaurants","#Melbourne #Indian - Babu Ji","Having moved into the digs of the former Melbourne Wine Room in Grey Street, St Kilda, Babu Ji has quickly established itself by offering fresh and unexpected Indian flavours as well as creating a lively buzz with non-stop Bollywood dance routines projected on the back wall. The okra fries are an exquisite and generous entree; the fig, pomegranate and cashew kofta is to die for; and the saag paneer is the best I've had in Melbourne – with fresh, smoked Indian cheese buried in tangy spinach and garlic sauce. A cardamom and pistachio popsicle and you'll be full. Babu Ji is stylish, flavoursome, modern and fun.\n\n4-6 Grey Street, St Kilda, open Mon-Tue 5-9pm, Thu 5-10pm, Fri-Sat noon-3pm and 5-10pm, Sun noon-3pm and 5-9pm. About $16 a curry."
"Restaurants","#Melbourne #Indian - The Curry Truck","Buying dinner from one of Melbourne's rapidly multiplying food vans can be a risky affair – in many cases they simply seem unable to provide much more than a snack between meals. That made the discovery of the Curry Truck on a Friday night in East Brunswick all the more satisfying. For just $12 you get the choice of several Indian, Indonesian or Thai curries, served with delicious roti bread and rice. Selections include butter chicken, Indonesian beef rendang, lamb curry and Thai red curry with tofu. They also serve delicious samosas and mango lassi and have a flat-screen TV showing what appear to be Bollywood action flicks to divert you while you wait. The servings are fresh and generous."
"Restaurants","#Melbourne #Indian - Curry Vault","ucked away in a bunker-like space in a laneway off Little Collins street in Melbourne's financial district, the Curry Vault delivers traditional Indian flavours in a subtly romantic setting. In the winter months the mulligatawny soup – a spicy variation on lentil soup cooked in south Indian style – is a perfect compliment to onion bhaji or gobi pakora (cauliflower fried in chick-pea flour). From there a massive selection of tandoori-style dishes, and a good selection of vegetarian options such as baingan masala (eggplant cooked with capsicum and herbs in chop masala) or mixed seasonal vegetable curry. For desserts, the mango and pistachio kulfi and the gulab jamun (sweet milk dumplings in sugar and rosewater) are delectable.\n\n18-20 Bank Place, Melbourne, open Mon 5.30pm-10pm, Tues-Fri noon-3pm, 5.30-10pm, Sat 5.30-10pm. About $20 for mains."
"Restaurants","#Melboune #Indian - Desi Dhaba","Taking its inspiration from the highway eateries that feed truck drivers throughout India, the staff here are decked out in Punjabi attire and are genuinely friendly – they recognise regular customers and are always up for a chat, no matter how busy. Menu highlights include chicken kadhai, seekh kabab and saag masala. The paneer butter masala is a particular winner. There is also a good range of vegetarian options. The lassi yoghurt drinks are a house speciality, along with a wider than usual selection of deserts including gulab jamun, pista kulfi and rasmalai. Signs saying ""horn OK please"" play on the roadside theme.\n\n134 Flinders Street, Melbourne, open seven days until late, price $13 per main meal plus extras."
"Restaurants","#Melbourne #Italian #Fine Dining - Il Bacaro","Countless romances and finances have been negotiated over classic flash-fried calamari and Moreton Bay bug spaghetti at this elegant Italian mainstay, currently powering through its third decade. It's all in the service, and a drinks list that's up-to-the-minute with what's happening on the wine frontier. The food is classic but far from old hat. It could as easily be scallops with corn puree and flying fish roe or an 18-hour veal cheek, which dissolves on touch.\n168-170 Little Collins Street, 9654 6778"

Vegetables come from his farm; beef from his own Chianina cattle. You'll find yourself sitting on a church pew-turned-banquette at the chef's Richmond osteria, eating it all as part of a three-, six- or nine-course menu that changes with his whims and the will of the garden gods. It might be a butterflied sardine with a gratin crust and a salty sprinkle of bottarga (salt-cured tuna belly). Or his own salumi – silky lardo, petals of coppa and chunky boar salami coupled with crisp fried pasta pillows.\n486 Bridge Road, Richmond, 9428 2558"
"Restaurants","#Melbourne #Italian #Fine Dining - Rosetta","Neil Perry made it his mission to prove fine dining doomsayers wrong with this casino-based behemoth of marble and $35 pastas. And he succeeded. This room is all excess, in a way that we love. Red velvet cushions and chandeliers form the backdrop to plates of freshly made ricotta, served still wobbling, and a wine list that could show you the time of your life if you have a wallet fat enough. It ain't cheap, and the bejewelled and bouffanted clientele reflect that, but if you have the cash to spare, you won't regret throwing it at a wood-fired pigeon and summer polenta.\nCrown Complex, 8 Whiteman Street, Melbourne, 8648 1999"

There's an ancient table in the dining room where they're cutting bread; people eating pasta alone at the bar and a backdrop of raw bricks and classic hits. Chef James Wilkinson's pasta is phenomenal too. Pappardelle is all slip and bite, or it may be light-as-clouds ricotta gnocchi in a well-balanced gorgonzola sauce. Raw slices of yellowfin tuna are draped over bundles of matchstick potato crisps licked with lemon aioli – it's a textural party.\n32 Best Street, Fitzroy North, 9481 3393"
"Restaurants","#Melbourne #Italian #Casual - Ombra","It's the youngest and most free-wheeling arm of the Grossi empire. A relaxed salumi bar at heart, you're eating house-made sheets of prosciutto and salami sat on Collins Street, armed with a litre of wine. Just here to drink? Floor boss Carlo Grossi won't judge. He's more likely to encourage you with an Aperol spritz, then equip you with a bevy of snacks: simple pizzas and cicchetti like tender calamari tangled with fried capers and chickpeas and dense polpette bathed in a rich tomato sugo and smoky scamorza.\n76 Bourke Street, Melbourne, 9639 1927"
"Restaurants","#Melbourne #Italian #Casual - Lupino","In four years, this city gem has garnered such loyalty among the Paris-end business crowd that trying to get a booking for Friday lunch is almost futile. Head chef Marco Lori cooks like a nonna and does so with pride. Cauliflower fritti are plump, lightly battered and fried crisp and come with truly garlicky aioli. Pizze form a thin, crisp and chewy stage for paper-thin prosciutto and fine Italian cheeses. It's worth visiting just for the bombolini: four doughnuts come drizzled with choc-hazelnut sauce and a side of icy yoghurt.\n41 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, 9639 0333"

"Restaurants","Queen Margot Movie Review & Film Summary (1994) | Roger Ebert","http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/queen-margot-1994\nWhen I saw ""Queen Margot"" for the first time in May 1994 at the Cannes Film Festival, it was like looking at the home movies of complete strangers - in this case, the French. All of the many, many characters on the screen were apparently intimately familiar to those around me, but I was at sea. Eventually a few familiar faces came swimming toward me from out of long-ago history classes: Catherine de Medici, for example. But the film didn't seem much concerned with explaining people and relationships, and devoted its energies instead to an almost unwatchable visual style, made up of endless closeups and a restlessly roving camera."

The mostly surf-and-turf menu means lots of shrimp and sea bass and lots of beef and chicken, all served on or off skewers according to your preference. A great selection of drinks rounds out the offerings. Live music gets under way many evenings, usually in the later hours.\n100 m west of Lazy Mon Beach Café (aka Stanford's), Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, 70403, Costa Rica "

That was so much food, but I can't think of anyone I'd rather sit down to eat lots of delicious meats with. \n\nI really enjoyed piling lots and lots of cooked meat on your plate and watching to struggle to clear it all off. In the end, you played it smart and just left it there… I'm pretty sure you ate more than I did this meal though babe! :P\n\nOH OH OH.\n\nYou made your very first s'mores here! ^__^ It was too sweet so I got to eat the rest of it, but it's a first for you and a first for US doing it together. I love you cutie! "

"Restaurants","Beachcomber","After a nice little hike in Crystal Cove State Park, which was mostly spent listening to you complain about how tired you were :P, we decided to have breakfast at Beachcomber. \n\nFor future references, parking is at Los Trancos! Walk across the street to the park then walk to the restaurant. That is all! haha\n\nIt was turning out to be a beautiful morning, and I think one of the main reasons you were set on coming to this location is that we saw photos of beignets on Yelp… So there was no way in heck we weren't gonna order them!!!\n\nWe shared the beignets and the eggs benedict for breakfast. We probably cancelled out any of the benefits we got from the hike, but whatever… it was all worth it to spend the morning with you exercising, getting some cool photos, and enjoying some delicious food!

Be more optimistic cutie!!! �"

"Restaurants","Mokkoji","You weren't feeling too well the few days leading up to our date so we decided we wanted to get something warm that would help your sore throat and congestion. Shabu shabu seemed like the perfect choice. What we didn't expect was that a heat wave would hit socal on this particular weekend. � it was still in the high 70's when we got to the restaurant, but fortunately, the AC was on blast. Lol. \n\nSomeone was getting a little hangry (Eileen �) because we were waiting a while to be seated. However, once we got out table, everything else went smoothly. \n\nWe both ordered the choice beef shabu shabu which was the bomb.com! The sesame sauce and the shoyu sauce both tasted great as well and by the end of our meal, we were both quite satisfied (AND READY FOR DESSERT… read pop bar for continuation of this date night �)"
"Restaurants","Eureka","I believe this was the Friday before we had our first date to Spectrum. You looked lovely wearing your white knit sweater. And it was kinda chilly sitting on the patio, which now I think about it surprises me because you get cold so darn easily.

Housed in the school's former bike shed, the interior and style will feel a bit like St. John Bread & Wine, which is appropriate, because the Canteen comes from the talents of Margot Henderson and Melanie Arnold, which means you can expect farm-fresh dishes and a distinct lack of frills."

"Restaurants","#Melbourne #Italian #Fine Dining - Centonove","Downstairs is tight and bustling; upstairs is quieter, but over both levels there's the gleam of light on glasses and deft service. The menu always reflects seasonal availability, so braised goat with soft polenta might not always be on, but dishes always turn traditional Italian modern. Yellowfin tuna is served crudo, its softness balanced by pistachios, mint and ruby grapefruit segments. Opened in 1997, the Kew restaurant is still punching with the energy of a place in its early prime.\n109 Cotham Road, Kew, 9817 6468"
"Restaurants","#Melbourne #Italian #Casual - Mister Bianco","Such is people's devotion to owner-chef Joe Vargetto's wine-braised beef cheek with creamed spatzle and pickled radicchio that when he attempted to remove it from the menu there was uproar. Mister Bianco is his neighbourhood restaurant in Kew, and it defines the term – it's equally good for big family birthday bashes as zero-occasion Tuesday nights. There are rooms upstairs and down, and the menu is built for flexibility uniting the finer stuff (seared tuna rounds sandwiching avocado mousse) and the easy classics (hand-cut pasta tangling up shellfish). Another fixture is the pavlova with lime curd and prosecco jelly.\n285 High Street, Kew, 9853 6929"
"Restaurants","#Melbourne #Italian #Fine Dining - The Grand","There's duck fat in the focaccia, wild boar tumbled through tagliatelle, and venison in the pan. That's all you need to know about this corner pub, long favoured by Italophiles, celebrities and celebrity chefs. Olives and house-baked breads arrive at linen-dressed tables in the chocolate-hued dining room, strung with bauble lights by Burnley neighbour Mark Douglass. If it's on, stick your fork in golden, buckwheat polenta-crusted sardines with fresh beans and minted, salted ricotta, or tender char-grilled calamari speckled with parsley and capers.\n\n333 Burnley Street, Richmond, 9429 2530"
"Restaurants","#Melbourne #Italian #Fine Dining - Cafe Di Stasio","Entering Cafe Di Stasio necessitates an encounter of sorts with the larger-than-life owner, Ronnie Di Stasio – the doorknobs are oversized casts of his expressive hands. The restaurant is a Melbourne institution, a slick, elegant, darkened den where modern art meets old-school service. The menu follows a faithful formula: a short selection of well-executed Italian dishes, supplemented by regular specials such as house-made pasta with crab and chilli, and maybe some roasted suckling pig, or duckling. It's an experience above all else, and like no other.\n31 Fitzroy Street, St Kilda, 9525 3999"

One venue, though, is unlisted—search for it on maps or the casino’s website, and you’ll come up short. Instead, head for STK on the 3rd floor and look for a dingy corridor nearby (at peak times, you’ll handily see a line snaking down). Lined with vinyl album-cover wallpaper, it leads to an unfussy New York–style pizza joint, with no tables and a few pinball machines for decoration. Order one of the ricotta-topped white pies by the slice, wash it down with a glass of red or white wine, and save room for cannolis.\n\nSecret Pizza, inside the Cosmopolitan hotel, 3708 S Las Vegas Blvd, 702-698-7000; cosmopolitanvegas.com"
