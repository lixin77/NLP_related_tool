"movie","폭스캐처. 2014","\n베넷 밀러. \n스티브 카렐. 채닝 테이텀. 마크 러팔로\n\n정성일 평론가\n이 영화가 시작하기 전에 아마도 1984년도 LA올림픽이 있었을 것이고, 마크 슐츠(이하 마크)와 데이브 슐츠(이하 데이브), 두 형제가 금메달을 땄을 것입니다. 그런 다음 영화는 1987년 3월부터 시작합니다. 구체적인 날짜는 그로부터 며칠이 지난 1987년 3월 17일에 마크가 초등학교에 가서 초라하게 연설을 하고 난 대가로 20달러를 받은 다음 햄버거 가게에서 다른 노동자들과 함께 햄버거를 산 후에 차 안에서 우걱우걱 먹는 장면으로 시작하고 있습니다. 이 금메달은 그들의 인생에 어떤 영향을 미치지 못했고, 그리고 그들은 영웅 대접을 받으면서 살고 있는 것도 아닙니다. 이 말은 아마도 1988년 서울 올림픽에서 금메달을 땄을지라도 존 듀폰의 후원이 없었다면 똑같은 삶을 반복했을 것이라는 뜻일 것입니다. 이렇게 살고 있는 마크에게 억만장자 존 듀폰(이하 존)으로부터 후원을 하겠다고 연락이 옵니다. 그런 다음 우여곡절을 겪고, 결국 데이브를 폭스캐처에 끌어들여서 차기 올림픽 준비를 합니다. 유감스럽지만 서울 올림픽에서 마크 슐츠는 금메달을 따지 못했습니다. 그러고 나서 마크는 존의 폭스캐처 농장을 떠났습니다. 영화는 이 대목을 매우 조심스럽게 찍고 있습니다.\n\n이 영화에서 베넷 밀러(이하 밀러)는 플래시백을 버렸습니다. 이것은 첫째로 존의 시선으로 풀지 않겠다는 뜻입니다. 즉 밀러의 인터뷰에 의하면 존의 시선으로 이야기를 풀어나가는 것은 처음부터 불가능 했습니다. 지금도 존이 왜 데이브를 죽였는지 아무도 알지 못합니다. 이상할 정도로 <폭스캐처>라는 영화에 접근하고 있는 많은 국내의 비평들이 임상병리학에 기초하고 있습니다. 그러니까 존의 정신 상태 혹은 마크와 존 사이에 대한 정신분석학적 설명에 몰두하고 있다는 것입니다. 이 사건에 실제로 접근했었던 범죄 심리학자들도 설명이 안 된다고 이 사건을 종결시켰고, 이 영화를 연출한 밀러 또한 이 살인 사건이 왜 벌어졌는지 설명하는 것이 불가능하다고 인터뷰에서 대답하고 있는데 말이죠. 아마 여러분들께서 이 영화를 보시고 난 다음에 잘 설명이 안 된다고 생각하셨다면 이 영화를 올바르게 보신 태도라고 할 수 있습니다. 뭔가 설명이 된다고 생각할 때부터 이 영화의 서사를 억지로 논리에 끼워 맞춰서 뭔가 가짜 얘기를 만들어내고 있는 겁니다. 그리고 두 번째로는 이 사건을 주관적으로 풀어나가지 않겠다는 뜻입니다. 말하자면 이것이 어떤 사건을 마주했었을 때, 영화가 이야기를 풀어나가는 전형적인 두 가지 방식이 있습니다. 즉, 이 상황의 핵심이 뭔지 알았어, 그러니까 내가 그걸 너희들에게 설명해 줄게 라는 방식, 그것이 플래시백 방식이겠죠. 또 하나는 난 존이라는 사람의 심리세계가 뭔지를 파고 들어가보고 싶어라는 주관적인 태도로 영화를 진행하는 것입니다. 그런데 밀러는 이 두 가지 방법을 다 버렸습니다. 그러면 감독은 막다른 골목으로 들어가게 됩니다. 왜냐하면 남는 방법은 딱 한 가지 밖에 없기 때문입니다. 너무 많은 사람이 알고 있는 실제 사건을 영화로 찍겠다고 했었을 때, 팩트를 벗어나지 않고 영화를 전개할 수 있는 방법은 단 한 가지, 연대기적으로 쫓아가는 방법 밖에 없습니다.\n\n밀러는 사건을 순서대로 다시 따라가면서 혹시 이 사건에 우리들이 놓친 어떤 고리가 있을 수 있다는 생각을 했습니다. 밀러는 그 고리를 찾고자 <폭스캐처>라는 영화를 찍은 것입니다. 약간 얘기를 우회해서 진행해 보겠습니다. 밀러가 연출한 <카포티>와 <머니볼> 그리고 <폭스캐처>에 이르기까지, 이 세 영화의 공통점은 모두 팩트에 기반한 인물의 영화라는 것입니다. 밀러는 어떤 실제 사건에 연루된 인물에 항상 관심이 있다고 말했습니다. 그런데 이야기를 따라가다 보면 어떤 대목에서 반드시 블랙홀 같은 것이 발견됩니다. 거기서 상상이 필요하게 됩니다. 그렇다고 픽션을 만들어서 논리를 짜맞추고 싶지는 않습니다. 단지 그 블랙홀을 영화의 방법을 동원해서 어떻게 그 안을 들여다볼 수 있는지를 실험해보고 싶습니다라고 말했습니다. 어쩌면 여기에 모든 답이 있을지 모릅니다. <폭스캐처>라는 영화를 여러분들께서 올바르게 감상하는 방법은 이 영화를 보고 나서 나는 존 듀폰이 왜 데이브 슐츠를 총으로 쐈는지 알았어가 아니라 존 듀폰이 데이브 슐츠를 총으로 쏘기까지의 긴 여정에서 어떤 대목이 블랙홀이야라고 밀러가 느꼈는지를, 이 영화에 연출방식, 편집 혹은 촬영, 사운드 이런 것들을 가지고 어떻게 건드리고 있는지를 느껴보는 그 감흥에 있다고 얘기할 수 있을 것 같습니다.\n\n우선 <폭스캐처>의 이야기를 별 문제의식 없이 쫓아가면 누구나 무슨 얘기인지 알 수 있습니다. 그런데 여러분들이 이 이야기를 다시 짜맞춰보면 이상할 정도로 서로 아귀가 맞지 않는다는 생각이 들기 시작할 것입니다. 그것이 제가 이 영화를 다시 보면서 이야기가 의외로 복잡하게 꾸려져 있다는 걸 발견한 연유이기도 합니다. 영화가 얼핏 보면 연대기처럼 보이지만, 앞으로 진행됐다가 뒤로 돌아가는 법이 없습니다. 그런데 문제가 생기는 것은, 보통 연대기로 진행되는 영화들의 공통점이라 하면 일정한 시간적 리듬을 갖고 그 시간을 진행하고 있는데 반해, 이 영화는 일정한 시간적 리듬을 가진 채 흘러가지 않고 있다는 겁니다. 이게 무슨 얘기냐면 어떤 대목에서는 이 시퀀스에서 다음 시퀀스로 넘어갈 때가 굉장히 촘촘하게 붙어있는데, 통상적으로 연대기로 쫓아갈 때, 확 건너뛰는 경우에는 반드시 년도를 써놓습니다. 그런데 이 영화는 경기장에 붙어있는 연도를 제외하고는 써놓지 않았습니다. 그래서 진행하던 영화가 어떤 시퀀스에서 갑자기 1주일, 며칠 단위로 진행하던 쇼트의 진행이 갑자기 몇 달을 확 건너뛰었는데도 어떤 표현도 없습니다. 그랬을 때, 여러분들은 이야기를 어리둥절하게 느낄 수 있습니다. 그러니까 많은 사람들이 한 번 보고나서 마크가 왜 떠난 거야? 혹은 데이브는 어떻게 폭스캐처 농장에 들어온 거야? 라는 질문들을 하게 되는 건, 이 영화가 두 번째 봤을 때, 꼼꼼히 설명했었음에도 불구하고 이 시간적 리듬을 건너뛰는 과정 속에서 관객 분들이 따돌림을 당했다는 뜻입니다.\n\n두 번째는 보통 연대기 영화들은 대부분 트릭이 있습니다. 그 트릭은 이 시간에서 저 시간으로 건너 뛸 때에 앞의 시간이 원인이고 뒤에 시간이 결과인 방식의 인과관계로 계속 시나리오로 구성합니다. 그런데 이 영화는 앞의 시퀀스에서 다음 시퀀스로 넘어가는 과정에 인과관계가 전혀 없이, 매번 얘기가 다시 시작하듯이 진행되고 있습니다. 그러니까 매번 쫓아는 가고, 무슨 얘기인지는 알겠는데, 이 이야기와 저 이야기의 관계가 뭐지? 라는 부분에 대해서는 절대적으로 여러분들이 그 관계를 만들어내야 합니다. 즉, 밀러는 계속해서 내가 이 사건이 벌어진 출발점, 그러니까 존이 처음 마크에게 연락이 와서 데이브를 총으로 쏘기까지 쫓아갔었던 과정에서 내가 겪었던 곤궁을 관객들 또한 똑같이 겪기를 바라고 있습니다. 그러니까 내가 이해 못했던 대목을 허구적인 논리를 만들어서 설명하지 않을거야라는 태도가 있습니다. 보통 우리가 이 얘기를 앞에서부터 쫓아오면 이 사건 자체를 몰랐었던 사람들은 1988년 서울 올림픽이 클라이맥스가 될 거라고 생각할 것입니다. 그런데 정작 영화는 단지 순간적으로 짧게 지나쳐버립니다. 게다가 거기서 마크는 모든 것을 잃었고, 존은 자기가 원하는 것을 얻지 못했습니다. 시나리오 구성 상 갈등이 폭발하는 지점이죠. 하지만 이미 그 장면 이전에 그들의 균열은 시작되었고, 이 균열이 시작된 어떤 하나의 과정 중에 시퀀스로만 이 서울 올림픽은 그저 스쳐 지나가고 있습니다.\n\n세 번째, 이 이야기는 한편으로 미국 관객과 미국 바깥에 있는 관객들 사이에 인물의 이야기들에 대한 어떤 간극이 있습니다. 말하자면 이 영화는 이 인물들의 이야기에 대해서 마치 내가 구태여 설명하지 않아도 잘 알잖아? 라는 태도가 있습니다. 우리들과 똑같이 난처한 느낌을 프랑스 비평가들도 받았었던 모양입니다. 그래서 밀러에게 똑같이 질문했었을 때, 밀러의 반문은 잘 알고 계신 얘기가 아니던가요? 였습니다. 그렇다고 이 영화가 이야기로서 불친절하다는 얘기를 하고자 함이 아닙니다. 요점은 이 영화는 존과 마크, 그리고 데이브 사이에 삼각관계가 정확하게 무엇이었는지를 설명하지 않기 위해서 필사적으로 노력을 기울이고 있다는 겁니다. 이제까지 여러분들이 관습적으로 보아온 영화들은 어떻습니까? 아마 이 얘기를 찍는다면 세 사람 사이에 관계가 무엇인지 설명하려고 필사적이 될 것입니다. 여러분들에게 이 영화를 보고 난 다음에 세 사람이 같이 있는 시퀀스가 몇 개가 됩니까? 라고 물으면 거의 기억나지 않을 것입니다. 셋이 한 장소에 있더라도 각각을 다 쪼개서 찍었습니다. 그러니까 우리 머리 속에서 이 사람들의 관계가 한 장면 안에 안 들어오도록 영화를 연출하고 있습니다. \n\n이제 이 영화에 대한 제 생각을 설명하고 싶습니다. <폭스캐처>를 설명하는 가장 도식적이고 간단한 방법은 존과 마크의 관계를 도착적 오이디푸스의 관계로 두는 겁니다. 영화에도 그러한 힌트가 많이 널려있긴 하죠. 존은 마크에게 코치는 멘토이자, 아버지라고 몇 번이고 얘기합니다. 심지어 맨 마지막에 비디오로 다시 돌려보는 장면에서 그 대목을 일종의 클라이맥스처럼 배치하기도 했습니다. 그러면서 한편으로 존은 마크에게 그런 태도를 보이면서 한편으로 정작 실제 삶에서는 인정받지 못한 아들, 그러니까 그의 어머니로부터 계속 버림받은 모습을 보여주고 있습니다. 그의 어머니는 아들 존이 레슬링에 몰두하는 것에 대해서 끝내 인정하지 않았습니다. 심지어 오죽하면 존이 코치로 올림픽에 나가기 위해서 체중 감량을 하고 있는 장소에 가 있었을 때에 돌아가시기까지 합니다. 이상하게도 이 영화에서 존 을 보고 있으면 겉모습만 어른이 된 어린아이처럼 찍은 장면들이 매우 많습니다. 그래서 그는 그가 특히 의자에 앉아있을 때의 모습을 보면 마치 어린애처럼 보이도록 의식적으로 스티브 카렐(이하 카렐)은 움츠려 있습니다. 말하자면 존은 어머니에게 사랑받고 싶어 하는 오이디푸스이자, 마크에게는 존이 말하자면 아버지이자 실제로 형인 데이브로부터 벗어나서 또 다른 아버지 존을 찾아 나섰다가 실패하는 이야기다라고 설명하고 싶도록 유혹하고 있습니다.\n\n그렇다면 존이 왜 마크가 아니라 데이브를 총으로 쏴 죽였냐는 의문이 생깁니다. 즉 자기를 배반하고 떠나간 마크를 내버려두고 왜 데이브에게 그랬냐는 겁니다. 그것도 마크가 이 폭스캐처 농장을 떠나간지 한참 뒤에 혹은 존이 데이브를 총으로 쏴 죽인 다음에도 이 영화는 이상하게 마크의 어떤 리액션도 찍지 않았습니다. 말하자면 그것이 어쩌면 존이 데이브 살인 사건을 저지른 한 가지 이유일 수는 있겠지만 그러나 우리는 그것만으로 만족스럽게 이 영화가 설명된다고 생각하기 힘듭니다. 두 번째는 은밀하게 혹은 노골적으로 읽어보는 겁니다. 영화는 우리에게 존이 게이일 거라는 수많은 암시들을 주고 있습니다. 그리고 그 자신이 게이이기 때문에 어머니로부터 인정받지 못한 일종의 인정투쟁극으로 읽히는 겁니다. 실제로 존은 결혼한지 6개월 만에 자기 아내를 총으로 위협하는 난동을 부려서 이혼하고 난 후에 내내 혼자 살았다고 합니다만 이 영화에 그 이야기는 완전히 빠져 있습니다. 무엇보다도 이 영화에서 레슬링에 매혹된 존이 남자들의 벌거벗은 몸에 심취하고, 그리고 엎치락뒤치락 하는 모습을 몇 번이고 반복해서 보여줍니다. 말하자면 이 장면들에서 이 영화를 퀴어 영화로 읽는 것도 가능은 할 것입니다. 하지만 이것으로 존과 마크의 사이를 제대로 설명하지 못하고 있습니다. 한 가지 떠올려봅시다. 밀러는 마치 이러한 해석에 저항하기라도 하듯이 존과 마크사이에 어떠한 터치도 의식적으로 찍지 않았습니다. 데이브와는 악수를 하거나 껴안는 장면이 있음에도 불구하고 존의 어머니가 돌아가시고 난 뒤, 다시 체육관에 나타났을 때에 위로하는 사람은 데이브이지 마크가 아닙니다. 즉, 밀러는 존이 게이일 수 있다는 암시는 우리에게 충분히 주고 있습니다만 그러나 이 두 사이의 관계를 퀴어적인 관계로 해석하는 것에 대해서는 자신이 동의하지 않는 것처럼 보일 정도입니다.\n\n세 번째 이 영화에 대한 해석은 좀 더 대담하게 읽힐 수 있습니다. 밀러가 이 사건 자체를 설명하고 싶다는 의문이 있었다기보다는 차라리 이 시기의 미국에 대한 알레고리를 <폭스캐처>를 통해서 말하고 싶었던 게 아닐까라는 겁니다. 존은 물론 이 영화에서 보면 여러 장면에서 미친놈이라는 걸 알 수 있습니다. 그렇지 않고서야 아무리 돈이 많아도 탱크를 수집하는 건 이상한 일입니다. 탱크 수집하는 장면에서 우리는 두 가지 방식으로 읽을 수 있습니다. 하나는 퀴어시네마로서 존의 왜소한, 잃어버린 남성성에 대한 결핍의 해석으로도 읽을 수 있을 테고, 또 다른 한편으로는 미친 군국주의자의 방식으로 읽을 수 있습니다. 존이 끊임없이 얘기하는 건 미친 제국주의입니다. 그는 자기 집이 조지 워싱턴의 승리를 이끌었었던 바로 그 장소에 집이 세워졌다는 걸 자랑하는 사람입니다. 그러니까 시체들 위에 세워진 집이 폭스캐처인 겁니다. \n\n그리고 밀러가 카렐을 캐스팅한 이유 중 가장 포인트가 될 만한 부분을 말씀드리자면 밀러는 카렐을 보고 있으면 두 번째 조지 부시 대통령이 떠오른다는 겁니다. 정확하게 존과 조지 부시는 똑같이 자란 사람이라는 겁니다. 억만장자 가문에서 태어났고, 그 가문에서 자란 후에 엉뚱한 일을 저지른 거죠. 한 사람은 살인 사건을 또 한 사람은 파병을, 그리고 그런 사람은 보통 사람이 이해가 안 되는 사람이라는 겁니다. 그러므로 이 살인 사건은 이해가 안 된다는 겁니다. 즉, 밀러는 두 사람이 모두 미친 애국주의자이고, 힘을 맹목적으로 숭배하고 있으며, 전쟁광이었다는 겁니다. 말하자면 밀러는 두 사람의 사이가 바뀌어도 아무 차이가 없을 거라고 얘기하고 있습니다. 그러나 이러한 텍스트들이 존에 대한 문화적, 정치적 아이콘으로의 설명은 되겠지만 그렇다고 데이브를 왜 죽였는지는 설명이 안 됩니다. 그러므로 우리들의 질문은 다시 원래의 자리로 돌아옵니다.\n\n이 영화는 매우 이상하게 끝이 납니다. 마지막 장면은 마크가 언젠가 동료들과 텔레비전에서 봤었던 내기 프로레슬링의 세계, 마치 새장처럼 보이는 곳에 갇혀서 참혹한 게임을 하기 위해 링에 오르는 장면입니다. 그 때 관중들이 마크를 외치는 게 아니라 USA를 미친 듯이 외칩니다. 그리고 그는 러시아에서 온 상대와 싸워야 합니다. 영화 초반부에 보면 존이 마크에게 “자네는 소련 선수들이 대우가 좋다는 걸 알고 있나?” 라는 말로 설득을 합니다. 이것은 마치 미국과 러시아, 두 나라 사이에 있었던 애국주의적 인식에 대해서 이 영화를 해석하고 싶을지도 모르겠습니다. 이렇게 밀러에게 질문하자, 그는 그건 마크가 실제로 그런 내기 프로레슬링 게임에 올라갔었을 때, 관중들이 외쳤던 모습을 재현한 것이었지, 그렇게 USA라고 외치는 것에 상징적 의도를 담은 건 아닙니다라고 대답하고 있습니다. 여기서 한 가지 분명해지는 것은 밀러는 이 영화가 그러한 방식의 도식적 상징주의로 읽히기를 원치 않고 있다는 것입니다.\n \n또 밀러는 인터뷰에서 미국이 이상한 나라인 건 이상한 살인 사건의 나라라는 점입니다. 말하자면 이건 이상한 살인사건의 영화입니다. 밀러가 첫 번째 찍은 극 영화 <카포티> 역시 마찬가지로 연쇄살인범에 관한 인터뷰로 소설을 쓴 소설가 트루먼 카포티에 관한 얘기라는 점을 떠올려 주십시오. 그는 이 이해할 수 없는 살인 사건들에 대해서 관심이 많습니다. 단, 이 살인 사건에 관한 영화를 찍을 때에 밀러는 이 살인 사건을 이해하려는 어떤 노력도 하지 않는다는 겁니다. 그러니까 악을 이해할 수 없는 자리에 고정시키는 것, 악을 이해할 수 있는 것으로 만드는 것에 대한 어떤 저항이 있습니다. 그런 영화들의 가장 큰 잘못 중에 하나는 살인 사건이 벌어지면 하이에나처럼 달려갑니다. 그런 다음 영화를 찍으면서 영화를 찍는 쪽은 선한 태도를 보이기 시작합니다. 그리고 살인자도 무언가 불쌍한 점이 있어, 그의 부모가 잘못 되었을 거야라는 식으로 자꾸 이해하려고 들죠. 그 때 그것을 이해하는 순간 밀러는 그건 악을 받아들이는 거라고 생각하는 겁니다. 즉, 이 영화에는 살인사건을 이해하는 것은 살인만큼 나쁘다는 윤리적 태도가 있습니다.\n\n만일 이 살인에 대해서 유일하게 이해할 수 있는 단어가 있다면 변덕입니다. 어쩌면 황당무계한 표현일 수도 있는 이 말에 대해서 밀러는 정작 <폭스캐처>라는 영화를 찍으면서 필사적으로 변덕을 시각화 하려고 노력하고 있습니다. 그리고 이 영화에는 이상할 정도로 비가 오고 구름이 끼고, 화창했다가 눈이 내리고 안개가 끼는 식으로 거의 종잡을 수 없는 날씨가 계속 되고 있습니다. 의도적으로 날씨를 일관성 없이 찍어놨습니다. 그러니까 날씨가 거의 변덕이라도 부리는 것처럼, 마치 날씨가 이 살인에 영향을 주기라도 한 것처럼 어떤 기운을 불러일으키고 있습니다. 이 영화를 촬영한 그레이그 프레이저가 참여한 작품 중 캐서린 비글로우가 연출한 <제로 다크 서티>가 있습니다. 밀러는 <제로 다크 서티>를 보자마자 그에게 연락을 했고, 만나자마자 얘기했다고 합니다. 당신이 그 영화를 찍을 당시, 아프가니스탄을 찍었을 때의 그 기분으로 <폭스캐처>를 찍어주십시오. 그 말뜻은 이 공간을 낯설게 찍어달라는 겁니다. 말하자면 이 영화를 보고 있는 미국인들에게도 이 영화가 낯선 장소처럼 보였으면 좋겠습니다라고 얘기를 한 겁니다. \n\n이 영화의 마지막 장면을 보면 간접적인 수많은 원인이 있었죠. 하지만 영화에서 본 직접적인 원인은 무엇이었습니까? 존이 비디오를 보다가 화가 나서 데이브를 죽이러 간 겁니다. 존은 이 때 비디오에서 무엇을 봤습니까? 두 가지 대답이 있습니다. 첫째는 마크와 껴안은 장면이 엔드로 나오죠. 떠나간 마크에 대한 상실감, 원망이 데이브에게 갔다라고 1차적으로 설명할 수 있겠죠. 그러나 거슬러 생각해 보면 데이브를 찍을 때, 촬영기사가 존은 이게 제일 중요하다고 생각해요 라고 말했습니다. 그런데 데이브는 촬영 중에 내내 꺼려하다가 결국 마지못해 멘토라는 말을 합니다. 밀러는 이 장면을 다른 장면들에 비해서 유난할 정도로 꼼꼼히 찍었습니다. 기억하란 얘깁니다. 그러므로 우리가 그 방에서 마크와의 장면을 보기 이전 앞 장면에서 틀림없이 그 장면을 봤을 겁니다. 아마 존은 이 비디오 테잎을 수십 번이고 다시 봤을 겁니다. 그 조롱이 견딜 수 없었을지도 모릅니다. 밀러가 이 영화를 찍으면서 이렇게 얘기했습니다. 난 그저 수면의 표면만을 찍을 뿐입니다. 표면 아래 무슨 일이 벌어지고 있는 것은 여러분들이 보셔야 합니다.\n"
"movies to watch","More movies","39 - Sleep Tight\n'REC' director Jaume Balaguero forgoes the blood and constant dread of the zombie movies for a chilling Spanish thriller about a hotel concierge who may not be as demure as he looks. Luis Tosar is excellent as a sad loner with a creepy disability, and Balaguero even manages to get the audience to sympathise with his  pro antagonist.\n\n38 - Chronicle\n\n\n\nChronicle was the biggest surprise of the year as first-time director Josh Trank combined intricate handheld live-action camerawork with CGI wizardry to a groovy effect in this found footage superhero thriller.\n\n37 - Mars et Avril\n\n\n\nA futuristic love triangle with superb visual effects that made the tiny indie look like a big budget film. Canadian director Martin Villenueve made a great debut and showed the kind of flair with his actors the way Marc Webb did in 500 Days of Summer.\n\n\n\n\n\n31 - The Day He Arrives\n\n\n\nA thoroughly mesmerising Korean film about a has-been filmmaker who arrives in Seoul to meet his friend for drinks and loses himself in a strange warped Groundhog Day. Director Sang Soo Hong revisits the theme of a filmmaker with midlife crisis from his 2008 movie Night and Day. Although a big recco for movie buffs, this is a must watch for those who make movies.\n\n29 - Sound of my Voice\n\n\n\n\nBrit Marling has delivered a one-two punch with Another Earth last year and Sound of my Voice this year - both futuristic/psychological thriller indies made on a shoestring budget with humongous helpings of narrative skill. Director Zal Batmanglij proves just why he has such a cool name, thanks to the double entendre ending.\n\n28 - Ruby Sparks\n\n\n\n\nThe guys who made Little Miss Sunshine outdid themselves with this film where a writer's character in his book comes to life. It's an utterly fascinating, constantly hilarious, and at times an unexpectedly dark metaphor for the complexities of a relationship and a man's urge to manipulate his girlfriend to be the way he wants her to be, rather than love her for the way she is. Whether or not the film is based on their own experiences, the mesmerising plot is buoyed by performances from Paul Dano and his off screen writer girlfriend Zoe Kazan\n\n24 - Marley\n\n\n\nHaving made One day in September and Life in a Day, director Kevin Macdonald was the perfect choice for the biopic of the legendary Rastafarian. Marley is perhaps the best retelling of Bob Marley's life we'll ever see. Macdonald mixes some fascinating footage with Marley's classic hits and delivers an extremely comprehensive account that is enough to drive fans crazy in emotion.\n\n23 - Tabu\n\n\n\nPortuguese filmmaker Miguel Gomes' odd and absorbing film is a sort of movie-within-a-movie with endless shots of philobabble on a haunting black and white palette. Just the sort of thing for those with a fetish for the Bela Tar Boiling Potato genre.\n\n22 - This is Not a Film\n\n\n\nJafar Panahi has been put under house arrest and banned by the Iranian govt from making movies. To be shown to the rest of the world, This is not a film was smuggled out of his house hidden inside a cake. The footage contains Panahi's account of a film that he wishes to make and is a heartbreaking political statement against the dictatorial Iranian government, one that echoes last year's No one knows about Persian cats.\n\n20 - Supermen of Malegaon\n\n\n\nIn an industry ruled by the Khans and Kumars director Faiza Ahmad's docu is a fresh breath of air. Clocking in at just over an hour, Supermen of Malegaon is beguiling and often funny, moreover it avoids sentimentality and all the cliches found in most documentaries. Easily the best Indian film of this year.\n\n\n19 - The Loved Ones\n\n\n\nAn absolutely bloody and shocking horror-black comedy from Australia, The Loved Ones has enough squirmy thrills to satisfy the die hardest fans of Martyrs. Robin McLeavy is great as a demented teenager who kidnaps her crush and tortures him after he refuses to go to prom with her.\n\n18 - The We and the I\n\n\n\nAfter a string of disappointments at Hollywood and mainstream, Michel Gondry makes a great return to indies with a brilliant story set entirely within a school bus on the last day of the academic year. Gondry puts you in a seat swarming with twenty high school characters, every one of which is superbly realised, each with its own individual back story. It's fun, quirky, visually riveting, with a hint of gloom - just like the old works of Gondry.\n\n17 - Safety Not Guaranteed\n\n\n\nAlready a cult classic and an internet favourite, Safety Not Guaranteed mixes the themes found in K-Pax and Back to the Future, with its own smart dose of new age comedy. The hilarious Aubrey Plaza (from Parks and Rec) finally gets a big starring role as a reporter who discovers a classified ad that leads her to a man who believes he has invented a time machine and is looking for a partner to travel with him. \n\n \n16 - Take This Waltz\n\n\n\n\nMichelle Williams stars in yet another heart wrenching story of doomed marriage and the frailty of a relationship. Also starring Seth Rogen, director Sarah Polley takes us through the most devastating couple seen on screen since Blue Valentine. \n\n14 - Compliance\n\n\n\nUnsettling from start to finish, Compliance pushes your boundaries of belief and and stuns you into submission. The film is based on a real life story of a bunch of McDonalds employees who were brainwashed by a mysterious cop on a phone who ordered them to perform strange duties. A post film dissection leads one to the mind boggling Milgram Experiment.\n\n13 - Snabba Cash\n\n\n\nSnabba Cash is Snabba Entertainment, and a cooler Swedish version of a Pusher style mafia thriller. Starring Joel Kinnaman (the new Robocop) and a vast array of characters, the film packs enough smarts to shame recent Hollywood gangster movies. A sequel is slated to release next year. \n\n12 - Holy Motors\n\n\n\nDirector Leos Carax returns to the screen after an absence of 12 years with a supremely indulgent, yet absolutely head spinning piece of cinema that works both a personal rant against film reviewers and a despondent look at the infirmity of a filmmaker's celebrity. The film features Denis Lavant as half a dozen characters thrust in bizarre imagery and situations all in one night, best of which is a LED-lit pseudo sex scene in a motion capture animation studio.\n\n11 - Polisse\n\n\n\nThe French film Polisse is the feel bad movie of the year and contains no redemption or hope. Director Maiwenn emerges as the Kathryn Bigelow of France after stepping out of the shadow of her ex husband Luc Besson and delivering an unsettling story of a Child Protection Unit. The powerhouse acting ensemble is so good that at some moments you forget that these are actors.\n\n10 - A Monster in Paris\n\n\n\nThe feel good film of the year is a French cartoon that contains some of the most exquisite animation ever put on screen. Director Bibo Bergeron crafts a smart, funny, quirky comedy that gets better and better as it plays and even contains a couple of fun song and dance numbers.\n\n9 - Sleepless Night\n\n\n\nStarring Tomer Sisley, this french action thriller is set almost entirely inside a nightclub. The single location with flickering lights and pulsating music of the discotheque makes for a very claustrophobic atmosphere, and combined with wall to wall action it simply becomes an insanely gripping watch.\n\n8 - Sleepwalk With Me\n\n\n\nComedian Mike Birbiglia makes a fabulous debut as a writer-director-star and doles out the best usage of irony in a motion picture this year. The film features a struggling standup comedian whose only way to get gigs is by poking fun at the festering relationship with his loving girlfriend.\n\n7 - Cafe de Flore\n\n\n\nCafe de Flore mixes dreams, reality, time, space, happiness, loss, incredible visuals and Sigur Rós song 'Svefn-g-Englar' to magnificent effect whilst shifting between two interlinked stories set 50 years apart. The 6-minute sequence featuring the aforementioned song is so captivating you won't believe it until you see it.\n\n6 - Beyond the Black Rainbow\n\n\n\nThis year's WTF Genre Champion is director Panos Costamos dark, brilliantly trippy, crazy as hell pastiche of THX 1138, Scanners, Eraserhead, Blue Sunshine, Russia and Kubrick. Beyond the Black Rainbow stars Eva Allen as a patient in a strange institution interrogated by an even weirder doctor, and it eventually turns into a horror movie. If the imagery in this film is anything to go by, we can expect some very imaginative films in the future from Cosmatos.      \n\n5 - Pieta\n\n\n\nKim Ki Duk offers a brutal, thoroughly humourless and devastating story from the black hole of exploding misery that is his South Korean mind in the story of a 30-year-old loan shark who comes across a woman who claims to be his long lost mother. Not only does the film make you writhe in your seat in distress but also leaves you almost entirely bereft of optimism.\n\n4 - The Imposter\n\n\n\nThe best thriller of the year is not a big budget Bourne or Bond, but surprisingly, this small documentary. The Imposter chronicles the shocking real life story of a 23 year old French man who impersonated a 15 year old boy from Texas and fooled the police, the immigration authorities and even the Texan family. Instead of being a mere docu drama, the film unfolds like a whodunit, and nothing can prepare you for the bizarre final twenty minutes.\n\n2 - The Hunt (Jagten)\n\n\n\nThe other side of last year's Michael, Thomas Vinterberg directs Mads Mikkelsen in the best acting performance of the year as a small Danish town's nursery school teacher who is suddenly accused of being a pedophile. Vinterberg superbly captures the paranoia and fear that can spread like a virus in even the most harmless society, and Mikkelsen is just terrific in his complicated role. Qualifies as the best feature film of the year, but is #2 on this list only because of the film below.\n\n\nHonorable Mentions: End of watch, Something in the Air, God Bless America, Killing them Softly, Ship of Thes"

Scarlett Johansson adopts a great British accent to play the blank slate alien who is learning about and digesting humans.  typically, sci-fi films fall into the mould of either fund films like star wars and guardians of the Galaxy, or more serious films like 2001 and interstellar. however, this film fits neither mould, instead reminding me more of another hard to label film of this year the Babadook in its ability to present metaphor as narrative.

"movies","Her - Spike Jones","In Spike Jonzes Her lebt ein Mann in Scheidung von seiner Jugendfreundin. Im Los Angeles der Zukunft formuliert Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) als Ghostwriter Liebesbriefe. Sein Arbeitgeber beautifulhandwrittenletters.com bietet diesen Service allen Paaren an, denen zum Selberschreiben die Fantasie fehlt. Seit seiner Trennung macht das Nachdenken über das Glück anderer Theodore allerdings immer trauriger - bis er das intelligente Betriebssystem OS One bestellt. Siehe da, die neue digitale Assistentin Samantha (gesprochen von Scarlett Johansson) organisiert nicht nur E-Mails und Termine, sie ist auch noch witzig, schlau und sexy. Sie flirten mithilfe des Knopfs in seinem Ohr, die Kamera des Smartphones wird Samanthas Auge in die Welt. So gehen sie gemeinsam Abendessen, machen Ausflüge ans Meer, treffen Freunde, haben Sex. Samantha ist neugierig, einfühlsam, ermutigend - auf Knopfdruck. Theodore wird zum Liebhaber einer Kunstfrau, geschaffen aus dem Datensatz seines eigenen Lebens.\nVerliebt in ein Betriebssystem. Eine Dystopie der Liebe, für die Spike Jonze den Oscar für das beste Drehbuch bekommen hat. Die Geschichte reicht gerade soweit in die Zukunft, dass wir uns selbst noch darin wiederfinden können. Ist es nicht so, dass unsere Gadgets uns immer näher kommen? Verbringen wir nicht  schon mehr Zeit mit unserem Smartphone als mit unseren Freunden? Und kann das nicht letztlich bedeuten, dass ein System, das unser digitales Ich kennt - unsere Korrespondenzen, unsere Notizen, unsere Facebook-Posts und Instagram-Accounts, die Filme, die wir sehen, die Musik, die wir hören -, dass so ein System uns besser versteht, als es je ein anderer Mensch könnte?\nAus Sehnsucht nach dem mit seiner Einzigartigkeit perfekt harmonierenden Partner verfällt Theodore dem Leistungswahn der Liebe. Er macht ihn überempfindlich gegen die kleinen Makel und Neurosen, die einen anderen Menschen erst zum Menschen machen, und er lässt ihn verzweifeln an den Entwicklungsschritten von Samantha, die sie von seinem Lebensentwurf wegführen. ""Sich zu verändern, ohne den anderen damit zu vergraulen"", so erklärt Theodore es eines Nachts Samantha, das sei das Geheimnis einer glücklichen Beziehung. Er jedoch lässt sich gleich zweimal vergraulen.\n"

"Lsvl library movies","Ed Wood - 92","Hollywood visionary Tim Burton pays homage to another Hollywood visionary, albeit a less successful one, in this unusual fictionalized biography. The film follows Wood (Johnny Depp) in his quest for film greatness as he writes and directs turkey after turkey, cross-dresses, and surrounds himself with a motley crew of Hollywood misfits, outcasts, has-beens, and never-weres. The real story, however, is his friendship with aging, morphine-addicted Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), whom he tries to help stage a comeback. Landau's unforgettable Oscar-winning performance must be seen to be believed, as must Rick Baker's Oscar-winning makeup. While it would have been easy to make a film simply ridiculing the bumbling director, Burton instead focuses on his driving passion for filmmaking and his unwavering persistence in the face of ridicule and failure. Possibly the most surprising aspect of the film is the genuine sentiment with which Burton treats the relationship between Wood and Lugosi; his devotion to Lugosi is touching, as is Lugosi's final soliloquy -- an inane bit of dialogue from the hilariously bad Bride of the Monster that grows into a poignant metaphor for the actor's life and ultimate triumph of his spirit. Even the look of the film is right; it manages to preserve the air of one of Wood's own films while retaining a sense of artistry in much of the composition on screen (note the scene at the drug rehab where Lugosi endures a horrifying night of detox). In all, Ed Wood is a unique film -- at times side-splittingly funny; at others, tragic or even frightening -- and a heartfelt tribute to the love of movies, good and bad alike. ~ Jeremy Beday, Rovi\n\n\nR, 2 hr. 4 min.\n\nDrama, Comedy\n\nDirected By:Tim Burton"

But something's been troubling him: Mel knows he was adopted, and he can't resolve his issues with the mother who gave him away years ago, much to the annoyance of his adoptive parents (George Segal and Mary Tyler Moore). Mel decides it's time he met his birth parents and resolved his feelings once and for all, and Tina (Tea Leoni), a psychology student, has offered to tag along to capture the event on video for a research project. But after a few minutes with Mel's ""real"" mother, they discover that a mistake has been made and they've been directed to the wrong person. A second meeting, this time with Mel's supposed dad, also turns out to be a mistake, and it's quite some time before Mel, Nancy, and Tina are finally face to face with Mel's biological parents -- a pair of burned-out hippies (played by Alan Alda and Lily Tomlin) who support themselves by dealing blotter acid daubed onto pictures of Ronald Reagan. It doesn't help that Mel finds himself attracted to the very leggy Tina, or that Nancy's head is turned by a bisexual ATF agent (Josh Brolin). Writer/director David O. Russell previously made a splash with his independent debut feature, 1994's Spanking the Monkey. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi\n\nR, 1 hr. 33 min.\nComedy"

Created by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, it stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman as Doctor John Watson. Six episodes have been produced, the first three of which aired in 2010. Series two aired in 2012, and a third series began production in March 2013. The series has been sold to over 180 territories.\nThe show was conceived by Moffat and Gatiss during train journeys to and from the Doctor Who production base in Cardiff, where they were both writers. They aspired to produce a modern-day version of Conan Doyle's stories in which Sherlock uses the technologies that are available to him today in order to help him solve crimes. Credited as co-creators, Moffat and Gatiss each write one episode per series, with the other written by Stephen Thompson.

The characters in the movie accidentally stumble upon a means of time-travel and what ensues is pure cerebrally challenging story-telling.\n\nThe movie has been noted for its well use of an extremely low budget, and Shane Carruth’s writing/directing talent. This one may not be for everyone, but if you’re ever willing to take the ride, you might want to be ready to take notes in order to not have to watch it 10 times over before the story makes sense… But that’s why fans of the film love it so much.\n"

"25 sci fi movies","11. The Man from Earth","As one of the most cerebral movies ever, Man from Earth is unique sci-fi in that focuses mostly on dialogue versus heavy effects or action. Man from Earth was conceived as a script by Jerome Bixby in 1968 until being completed on his death bed 30 years later. Bixby is credited as a writer for the original Star Trek series as well as Twilight Zone and the original blueprint for Issac Asimov’s Fantastic Voyage. The film was directed by Richard Shcheknman and released in 2007.\n\nThe film was widely shared amongst internet users via peer-to-peer networks, which Scheknman later thanked the fans for. Following a man who does not age as he begins to move to a new city, which he does every ten years so people will not recognize his unique ability to not age, the story mostly focuses on the man, John Oldman played by David Lee Smith, as he converses and opens up about his true nature to a group of people.\n\nAs one of the most minimal, yet beautiful sci-fi stories ever told, Man from Earth will remain an absolute masterpiece.\n"

Joseph Gordon Levitt plays a criminal who is sent back in time to assassinate individuals. Bruce Willis plays the character’s future self, and their chemistry is fantastic.\n\nOne of the movie’s best elements is its refreshingly pulpy tone, which one rarely sees in sci-fi nowadays. As one of the most well received movies of recent years, Looper is a fantastic entry in the log of sci-fi history.\n\n"

It’s also one of Jake Gylenhaal’s first big performances, and he shines as the title character.\n\nEven the biggest fans of the movie still debate the truths of the universe created within the movie, which I’m pretty sure was Richard Kelly’s exact intention. Long live Frank the bunny.\n"

John Maclean, el que fuera teclista de The Beta Band, ha realizado el que quizá sea el mejor western, el más estilizado y poético, desde, no sé… ¿’Valor de ley‘? ¿’El asesinato de Jesse James por el cobarde Robert Ford’? Tras rodar dos cortos con Michael Fassbender de protagonista (con el último, ‘Pitch Black Heist’, se llevó el Bafta), Maclean debuta en el largometraje junto al actor germano-irlandés realizando un filme violento y romántico sobre el salvaje oeste. La película incluye canciones de Lone Pigeon o Django Django y una fabulosa banda sonora, con ecos de Nick Cave, compuesta por el australiano Jed Kurzel (quien se dio a conocer con la premiada música de ‘Snowtown’).

Pero, como los buenos aficionados al género de terror saben, también es el creador de una pequeña y jugosa golosina: ‘Trick ‘r Treat’, una película que nunca llegó a estrenarse comercialmente (fue directamente a dvd en 2009) y que casi inmediatamente adquirió categoría de culto. Casi una década después (‘Trick ‘r Treat’ la rodó en 2007), Dougherty vuelve a dirigir otra película de terror festivo con aroma a Halloween. ‘Krampus’ está basada en la leyenda del demonio del mismo nombre, una especie de anti-Santa Claus que durante la Navidad castiga a los niños que han sido malos.

"movies","Julie Taymor:  Frida (Kahlo)","FRIDA  - 2002\nvon Julie Taymor, \nmit Salma Hayek und Roger Rees\n\nREGIE Julie Taymor\nSCHAUSPIELER\nSalma Hayek FRIDA KAHLO\nRoger Rees GUILLERMO KAHLO\nSaffron Burrows MISTRESS\nPatricia Reyes Spíndola MATILDE KAHLO\n\n\nFRIDA\nMexiko-Stadt, zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts: Durch einen schweren Verkehrsunfall wird der lebenslustige Teenager Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayek) dauerhaft ans Bett gefesselt. Doch Fridas unbändiger Lebensmut ist nicht zu stoppen. Mit Hilfe der Malerei schafft Frida es, sich von ihrem monotonen Alltag abzulenken und ihr körperliches und seelisches Leid auf Leinwand zu verarbeiten. Durch ihre ausdrucksstarken Bilder zieht Frida auch die Aufmerksamkeit des berühmten Malers Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina) auf sich – der Beginn einer lebenslangen, leidenschaftlichen Liebesbeziehung, in der Loyalität vor Treue steht.\nHintergrund & Infos zu Frida\nFrida Kahlo de Rivera (1907 – 1954) ist die berühmteste Malerin Mexikos, möglicherweise sogar von ganz Lateinamerika. Durch die mexikanische Regierung wurden Frida Kahlos Werke zum nationalen Kulturgut erklärt. \nMit sechs Jahren erkrankte Frida Kahlo an Kinderlähmung, wodurch sie ein dünneres und kürzeres rechtes Bein zurückbehielt. Als Frida 18 Jahre alt war, bohrte sich bei einem Busunfall eine Metallstange durch ihr Becken, wonach sie die meiste Zeit liegend in einem Gipskorsett verbringen musste. Zeit ihres Lebens wurde die Mexikanerin immer wieder an Rücken und Beinen operiert und war in den letzten Jahren auf den Rollstuhl angewiesen. Die Malerei war stets Fridas Ventil, auch in Hinsicht auf ihre stürmische Beziehung mit dem Maler Rivera, die trotz fortwährender Liebe von Seitensprüngen und Affären auf beiden Seiten geprägt war. Von ihren insgesamt 143 Bildern sind 55 Selbstporträts, in denen Frida Kahlo ihre Markenzeichen, den Damenschnurrbart und die zusammengewachsenen Augenbrauen, bevorzugt betonte.\nFrida wurde von Regisseurin Julie Taymor in Szene gesetzt und von Hauptdarstellerin Salma Hayek (ihreszeichens die erfolgreichste Schauspielerin Mexikos) co-produziert. Bei den Oscar-Verleihungen von 2003 war Frida sechsmal für die begehrte Trophäe nominiert (u.a. Beste Hauptdarstellerin) und war in den Kategorien Beste Filmmusik und Beste Maske erfolgreich. Frida Kahlos Nichte war von dem Film so begeistert, dass sie Hayek eine Halskette ihrer Tante schenkte. (JW)\n"

"movie","피아노","벙어리, 여자, 피아노, 미남의 세련된 남편, 충남의 거칠고 과묵한 남자.\n\n도도하고 경직된 표정. 감정을 드러내지 않는 얼굴. 피아노만이 표출의 시간과 수단이다. 살아도 죽은 듯하다. 피아노를 칠 때만 살아있다. 피아노에 대한 집착과 열정.... 피아노만이 살아있는 시간이고 수단이다. 피아노를 통해서 한 남자에게도 삶을 열어준다. (사건의 주요 전개가 되어주는 것은 피아노를 치게 해주고,한 번의 만남에 건반 하나씩이라는 자극적인(?) 또는 흥미로운 거래가 성사와 진행, 이에 따른 두 남녀의 관계 발전이 주요 전개의틀을 이룬다.)  결말은 버려니는 피아노와 함께 바다 밑으로 가라앉으려 했던 그녀가 '자발적'으로 끈을 풀고 물위로 올라오는 것이다. 세월이 흐르고 인공 손가락을 낀 씬까지...\n\n가장 인상적인 장면... 남편에게 손가락이 잘리는 씬. 끌려갈 때의 발버둥, 도끼가 내려 찍히기 직전의 공포와 체념과 분노가 섞인 표정, (이 때 남편의 다리를 부여 잡고 가랑이 사이로 내민 여자의 표정을 클로즈업으로 담은 감독의 감각적인 선택) 손가락이 잘린 다음의 조용한 분노."

Of course there are hitches—Aditi has been having an affair with a married TV host; she’s never met her husband to be, who lives in Houston; the wedding has worsened her father’s hidden financial troubles; even the wedding planner has become a nervous wreck—as well as buried family secrets. But Nair’s celebration is ultimately joyful and cathartic: a love song to her home city of Delhi and her own Punjabi family. \nhttp://www.criterion.com/films/2364-monsoon-wedding"

But while Appropriate Behavior explores some similar bohemian Brooklyn and cringe comedy territory, it’s grounded in the liminal perspective of a heroine whose bisexuality and Iranian-American background make her feel like she’s always halfway between worlds. It also features the year’s most excruciatingly eloquent attempted threesome, one that conveys social expectations and awkwardness without saying a word."

"movies to see","the sisterhood of night","Smarter than your typical teen movie, The Sisterhood of Night uses the hook of a social media era riff on the witch trials as a way to offer up an unusually delicate portrayal of teenage girl power plays, jealously, and loneliness. Georgie Henley (The Chronicles of Narnia) and Kara Hayward (Moonrise Kingdom) play classmates whose rivalry escalates into town hysteria, but while everyone’s screaming about satanic rituals, the actual isolation and pain for which the girls are just trying to find an outlet go ignored. Directed by Caryn Waechter, it’s a minor film, but one that’s gone unfortunately overlooked in favor of blander, bigger YA fare. "
"movies to see","10,000 Km","Game of Thrones alum Natalia Tena and David Verdaguer play a couple spending a year on separate continents in this debut film from Spanish director Carlos Marques-Marcet. It’s a long-distance love story, or maybe it’s better described as an anti-love story, as the movie explores the ways technology gives us the illusion of intimacy while failing as a replacement for actually being together in person. Incorporating video chats and set entirely in the pair’s apartments in Barcelona and Los Angeles, this movie merits a trigger warning for anyone fresh off a breakup — the slow-forming cracks in its central relationship are all too real. "
"movies to see","Kumiko, The Treasure Hunter","Pacific Rim’s Rinko Kikuchi stars in this funny-sad film that’s a fictionalized take on the urban legend surrounding Takako Konishi, a real Japanese woman who committed suicide in Minnesota in 2001, and who was incorrectly reported to have died looking for the nonexistent treasure in the Coen brothers’ film Fargo. Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter combines this doomed quest with a melancholy, deadpan portrait of depression — its title character a Tokyo office lady (and rabbit owner) who lives in busy solitude and who pulls the ripcord on an urban life in which she’s unable to find a place."

Co-writer/director Sean Baker neither looks down on his characters nor pretends that their complicated and difficult lives haven’t shaped them into the complicated and difficult women they are. The result is at once hysterical, harrowing, and heartwarming. Famous for being shot on the iPhone 5S, this movie is also one of the most visually stunning of 2015. —A.B.V."

In fact, it’s actually based on a manga that was based on the imagery of the classic silent film. In no way is the film derogatory of the original, though; in fact, it’s one of the most original anime films we’ve seen in decades.\n\nThe film’s plot is slightly cliché, but is made up for by the film’s visceral and eccentric visuals. Metropolis is a mandatory addition to any sci-fi, or anime, fan’s collection.\n\n"

La película más ambiciosa de Mia Hansen-Løve (‘Un amour de jeunesse’, ‘Tout est pardonné’) es una melancólica mezcla entre el retrato generacional (los jóvenes parisinos de los noventa) y la crónica sobre el auge de la música electrónica –el garage house- en Francia. Aly-Us, Liquid, Frankie Knuckles, The Orb y, por supuesto, Daft Punk (que aparecen como personajes secundarios), suenan en ‘Eden’ como pespuntes sonoros para hilar una historia de iniciación basada en la vida de Sven Løve, el hermano mayor de la directora, quien fue DJ residente de la discoteca parisina Queen.

"movies","Only lovers left alive - Jim Jarmusch","Die Liebe von Adam und Eve ist der Kern der Zwiebel\nDa sind zunächst einmal Adam und Eve in Jim Jarmuschs Only lovers left alive. Eve (Tilda Swinton) lebt in Marokko, in der Altstadt von Tanger, sie liebt Shakespeare und Freud, Bücher sind ihr Element. Adam (Tom Hiddleston), ihr Ehemann, ist Musiker in Detroit. In einer baufälligen Villa am Stadtrand hat er sein Studio. Adam sammelt alte Instrumente, mit dem Kennerblick eines Musikgenies kauft er gerade die legendären E-Gitarren der Siebziger.\nZwischen Adam und Eve liegt ein Ozean. Doch, was viel wichtiger ist: Hinter ihnen liegen mehrere Hundert gemeinsam verbrachte Jahre, denn Adam und Eve sind Vampire, 1868 feierten sie ihre dritte und bislang letzte Hochzeit. In der Gegenwart des Films beruht ihre Beziehung auf Skype-Gesprächen von Eves iPhone zu Adams internetfähigem Schwarz-Weiß-Fernseher. Sie teilen weder Hobbys, noch Freundeskreise, noch die Wohnung. Allein das Gefühl, dass der melancholische Adam mehr als üblich am Zustand der Welt leidet, veranlasst die Eve zu einem ausgedehnten Besuch in Detroit. Dort stört dann nur das rebellische Schwesterlein Ava die traute Zweisamkeit.\nJim Jarmusch sagt, es sei ihm mit Only lovers left alive vor allem darum gegangen, einen Liebesfilm zu drehen. Da er zudem einen Faible für schräge Blutsaugerstreifen hat, sind die Protagonisten eben Vampire. Doch ermöglicht Jarmusch gerade dieser Kunstgriff, die Utopie einer perfekten Wir-Verwirklichung zu präsentieren. Adam und Eve sind nie zu erschöpft für Sex, nie unaufmerksam, nie in Versuchung fremdzugehen. Wer keinen Job hat und nur nachts vor die Tür kommt, hat mit der Vereinbarkeit von Beziehung und Beruf schon mal kein Problem. Die Liebe von Adam und Eve ist der Kern der Zwiebel. Statt eines ermüdenden geteilten Alltags sind da Verständnis und Begehren.\nKognitive Liebe nennt Niklas Luhmann, wenn sich ein Liebender in die Welt des Geliebten so hineindenkt, dass er sich über die beobachtende Teilnahme am Leben des anderen hinaus ein Bild davon machen kann, vor welchem Hintergrund dessen Weltbetrachtung entsteht. Kurz gesagt: Wer wie Adam und Eve genau weiß, wie der Geliebte tickt, hat bessere Chancen, dass die Liebe hält.\nDer Philosoph Axel Honneth macht es noch konkreter: Liebe ist das Versprechen, den anderen nicht für irgendwelche beliebigen Qualitäten zu lieben, sondern für genau die Wünsche und Interessen, die der Geliebte in seinem Selbstverständnis als maßgeblich betrachtet. Die Perfektion der Beziehung von Adam und Eve liegt darin, dass sie sich tatsächlich genau so lieben, wie sie sind. Eve versucht nicht, Adam die Melancholie auszutreiben. Er will sich das Leben nehmen? Na, dann haben sie den Blues eben gemeinsam. Und sie tanzen, eng umschlungen, zu Trapped by a thing called love.\n\n"

However, the original theatrical (redux was theatrical too), is the one you probably should watch first. I forget the ratio, but it was something like 700 edits to every one edit that made it into the film. \n\nCoppola went so crazy making this film that he basically can't make a good film anymore. For more insight you can watch Hearts of Darkness, which is a fantastic documentary that his wife shot about the making of Apocalypse Now."

Ihr Ziel ist das angrenzende Mexiko, wo sie vor dem Zugriff der amerikanischen Polizei sicher sein werden. Den stark bewachten Grenzübergang passieren die Brüder mit Hilfe des Geistlichen (Harvey Keitel) samt dessen Kindern (Juliette Lewis und Ernest Liu), die die Geckos als Geiseln nehmen. Da Seth und Richard erst am nächsten Morgen von dem Unterweltboss Carlos (Cheech Marin) abgeholt werden, beschließen sie, in der Titty Twister Bar Rast zu machen, die From Dusk Till Dawn geöffnet ist. Den Geiseln versprechen sie die Freiheit, sobald Carlos sie abgeholt hat. Doch zu später Stunde entpuppen sich die anderen Barbesucher als blutgierige Kreaturen und die Fünf müssen sich als Gruppe beweisen, um diese Nacht zu überleben.\nHintergrund & Infos zu From Dusk Till Dawn\nRobert Rodriguez nahm für From Dusk till Dawn auf dem Regiestuhl Platz, nachdem sein Freund Quentin Tarantino, der das Drehbuch zu diesem blutigen Mix aus Roadmovie und Vampirfilm geschrieben hatte, ihn darum gebeten hatte. Zuvor war auch Robert Kurtzman, von dem die Story zu From Dusk till Dawn stammt, als Regisseur im Gespräch gewesen, er musste jedoch aufgrund anderer Verpflichtungen absagen. 1999 und 2000 folgten die Fortsetzung From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money bzw. das Prequel From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman’s Daughter, bei denen Robert Rodriguez und Quentin Tarantino jedoch nur noch als Produzenten tätig waren. Beide Filme waren Direct-to-Video-Veröffentlichungen und waren nicht annähernd so erfolgreich wie der Originalfilm, der mehr als das doppelte seines Budgets eingespielt hatte. (GP)\n"

"Lsvl library movies","The oxbow incident - 94","This now-classic indictment of mob rule was a pet project of both star Henry Fonda and director William Wellman, both of whom agreed to work on lesser 20th Century-Fox projects in exchange for this film. After a hard winter on the range, cowboys Gil Carter (Fonda) and Art Croft (Harry Morgan) ride into a fleabitten small town for a drink. Within minutes, they get mixed up in a barroom brawl, which earns them the animosity of the locals. By and by, word reaches town that a local rancher has been killed by rustlers. With the sheriff out of town, a lynch mob is formed under the leadership of Major Tetley (Frank Conroy), a former Confederate officer who hopes to recapture past glories. Worried that they'll be strung up, Carter and Croft reluctantly join the mob and head out of town. In the dark of night, the group comes across three sleeping transients: a farmer named Martin (Dana Andrews), a Mexican (Anthony Quinn), and a senile old man (Francis Ford). The fact that Martin carries no bill of sale written by the so-called murder victim is evidence enough for Tetley to demand that the three men be hanged on the spot. Carter knows that this is a gross miscarriage of justice, but he's helpless to intervene. Resolving himself to his fate, Martin gives Carter a letter to deliver to his wife. The three unfortunates die at the end of the rope, and the mob rides off, only to discover that there never was a murder of any kind. Based on a novel by Walter Van Tilburg Clark, The Ox-Bow Incident is not so much a western as a gothic melodrama, with deep, looming shadows and atmospheric underlighting worthy of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Though the film lost a fortune at the box office (a fact that Fox head Darryl F. Zanuck never tired of pointing out to Fonda and Wellman), it gains in stature with each passing year. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi\n\nUnrated, 1 hr. 15 min.\nWestern, Drama, Classics"

Have you read Stoner by John Williams…a bit dark, but I adored it.  Very well written…just finished The Dog Year by Ann Garvin…truly fluff I give it a five on a scale of one to 10…have you ever read Beautiful Unbroken by Mary Jane Nealon…one of my all time favorites its a memoir and really finely crafted.  I adore Kent Haruf who wrote Plainsong as well as The Tie That Binds…he just recently died (a dreadful loss for those of us who love words) but he has a new book out published post death…I am so eager to read it but only buy trade paper   One of my all time favorites is The Power of One by Bryce Courtnay.  I have a list/stack of books here about to read….they are:  Butchers Crossing by John Williams, The School of Essential Ingredients by Erica Bauermeister, The Lifeboat by Charlotte Rogan, My Brilliant Friend by Elena Ferrante, The Door by Magda Szabo…some were on the cheap table at Booksmith…others suggested, a few loaned though I don't like to borrow books…someone told me of a book called Half A Yellow Sun….its about Africa…not sure I will read it though my friend loved it."

Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) doesn't steal things, he steals ideas. By projecting himself deep into the subconscious of his targets, he can glean information that even the best computer hackers can't get to. In the world of corporate espionage, Cobb is the ultimate weapon. But even weapons have their weakness, and when Cobb loses everything, he's forced to embark on one final mission in a desperate quest for redemption. This time, Cobb won't be harvesting an idea, but sowing one. Should he and his team of specialists succeed, they will have discovered a new frontier in the art of psychic espionage. They've planned everything to perfection, and they have all the tools to get the job done. Their mission is complicated, however, by the sudden appearance of a malevolent foe that seems to know exactly what they're up to, and precisely how to stop them."

"Taichi  the movie","Ideer","Tai chi - tegnet som grafik - forklaret\n\nPræsentation og voice over - Jeg hedder - har trænet taichi i 25 år. \nDet der fascinerer mig - det jeg får ud af det , det der bliver ved med at få mig til at komme tilbage. Jeg kan bruge det til - For mig er det en slag meditation i bevægelse. En måde at være til stede på, en måde, at give sindet en pause, \nStandse den indre stemme og bare være tilstede med det der nu er - glæde, sorg, vrede. Være i det, og gennem bevægelsen transformere det til brugbar energi. En fysisk og mental opladning. Standse sindets evige bevægelse og komme til det dybere lag af ro og tilstedevær. Jeg tillader en hvilken som helst stemning at være der. Der er ikke som sådan et humør eller en stemning, der er finere eller mere rigtig end andre, men nogle stemninger er mere hensigtsmæssige end andre. Agression og vrede, højt energiniveau eller lavt - -Det virkeig fine (og svære) består i, at følge situationen, bevæge sig med det der er tilstede. Vente og følge den retning, der viser sig. Forholde sig til den kraft eller retning der kommer inde.. eller udefra. Hvis nogen skubber udfra eller en indre følelse, der manifesterer sig i en bevægelse. Den fysiske side gør det lettere for sindet, at forblive fokuseret og ikke lade tankerne vandre. Sindet vil vandre, og derfor giver det mening at give kroppen en lille udfordring, for at holde hjernen beskæftiget. \n\nFlow - versus - stagnation.\nHårdhed versus blødhed. Forskellen på et sværd og en pisk.\nSværdet hærdes, slibes, mens pisken gøre blød og smidig - olieres og smøres. Hver led skal have blødhed og fleksibilitet. Et hårdt eller stift led trækker kraft ud af slaget. \n"

Остались только хозяин тарного цеха Иво, его сосед, владелец мандариновой плантации Маргус и местный доктор Юхан, который уже готов покинуть селение. Маргус также собирается уехать в Эстонию, но лишь после того, как будет собран урожай мандаринов. Война доходит до села, происходит боевое столкновение между грузинами и абхазцами. После боя Иво и Маргус находят одного оставшегося в живых чеченского наёмника по имени Ахмед, который воюет на абхазской стороне. Иво забирает Ахмеда к себе домой, чтобы его вылечить. Ночью, хороня погибших, Маргус обнаруживает, что, несмотря на тяжелое ранение, в бою выжил и один грузин — молодой парень Ника. Его тоже относят в дом Иво. Так под одной крышей оказываются бойцы противоборствующих сторон… \nhttp://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/772017/"

It uses the shooting style to its advantage in every way, leading to a series of effectively thrilling sci-fi scares.

He meets Julia (Suzanna Hamilton), who works for the Ministry of Truth, and they engage in a stoic love affair.

With this tool active, drag to add hyperlinks regions on top of any areas of the page. Then when prompted choose the type of URL you wish to add and enter the destination. For eBook page cross references just enter the InDesign page name to link to. For URLs paste full path from a browser. To add phone numbers enter the full phone number including area code and for Email addresses just add the full email address.\n\nHyperlink regions must be rectangular but can be rotated if required.\n\nOnce one hyperlink has been added using the 'Draw Hyperlink Regions' tool simply draw another frame to repeat the process or switch tools to finish adding hyperlinks.\n\nWith a graphic object selected in InDesign click the 'Add Hyperlink to selected object' button to add your hyperlink to an InDesign object.

"movies to see","spring","Like Before Sunrise, Spring is a talky romance set in Europe, where American schmoe Evan (Lou Taylor Pucci) attempts to woo a beautiful, mysterious woman named Louise (Nadia Hilker). It works surprisingly well — so well that even Evan seems taken aback, like he’s worried she’s going to get all Hostel on him. But this film from directors Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead, who also made the interesting Resolution, takes a wild turn instead into the supernatural, more dark fantasy than horror. If it doesn’t entirely sell the grandeur of its romance, it’s refreshingly hard to guess where it’s going. —"

I was happily reminded that this painting was a huge influence on my training as a watercolour painter. I remember seeing the painting in the flesh at ‘The Great Age of British Watercolours’ exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1993. \nActually, all these techniques are what taught me to paint in watercolour, gouging at the paper with a knife (I’ve since been using an electric grinder with a wire brush attachment), making huge washes of mixed tone and then lifting them off again. ‘The Falls’‘ is a large piece at 40 x 27 inches -103 x 70 cm, on a scale in deliberate competition with oils. If paper had been large enough, Turner would have painted even bigger. (I have larger paper and I have just completed my biggest watercolour at 120 x 60 inches – 3 x 1.5 metres, but that’s another story).\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichenbach_Falls\n"

Two statements may be said concerning this individual. One is that he suffers from defects of spontaneity and individuality which may seem to be incurable. At the same time it may be said of him he does not differ essentially from the millions of the rest of us who walk upon this earth.\n~ Erich Fromm\n\n"

Killed within minutes, Cage now finds himself inexplicably thrown into a time loop-forcing him to live out the same brutal combat over and over, fighting and dying again…and again.

The movie uses a time-loop device that writer/director, Nacho Vigalodo, gives quite the twist-y treatment as the plot progresses. The ultimate result of the film resembles early episodes of Twilight Zone, but its dark, droll tone makes it a truly unique achievement.\n\nRead more: http://www.tasteofcinema.com/2014/the-25-best-sci-fi-movies-of-the-21st-century/#ixzz3a41xBe00"

"25 sci fi movies","10. Sunshine","s Danny Boyle’s only attempt at sci-fi, this movie has remained a cult classic since its release in 2007. Although Cillian Murphy is the centerpiece to this flim, Boyle had quite an ambitious vision for all of the acting in this movie. He actually had all of the actors live together for a short period of time to study the knowledge that their characters in the film should be aware of.\n\nThe film follows a group of scientists who are on a mission to the sun in order to keep it from burning out. The movie has some of the breathtaking effects of the 21st century, and although it has been ridiculed for its harsh change in tone during its final act, this one remains a beautiful piece of work, and most likely will hold its position as a sci-fi cult classic for years to come.\n\n"

Jake Gylenhaal assumes the main role in this time-travel thriller that I must say is the closest film to this years Edge of Tomorrow that I have ever seen.\n\nIn the movie, Gylenhaal’s character keeps repeating the same events, but doesn’t know why. He soon finds himself in a loop and slowly uncovers the truth behind the events. If you’ve seen Edge of Tomorrow, that does sound quite familiar, doesn’t it? Well, just wait until the final act. The resolution to this movie is what makes it truly rewarding and unique, and is an essential addition to any sci-fi fan’s collection.\n"

Upon arriving there, though, he soon finds a clone of himself, and realizes the scale of time-travel technicality involved in the mission.\n\nMoon is an amazing directorial debut from Duncan Jones as well as a challenging, albeit rewarding piece of science fiction from the late 2000’s.\n\n"

Lars Lindstrom (Ryan Gosling) ist anders. So anders, dass selbst sein Bruder Gus (Paul Schneider) und seine Schwägerin Karin (Emily Mortimer) kaum Kontakt zu ihm haben. Doch Lars’ Einsamkeit hat ein Ende als Bianca in sein Leben tritt. Als er seine Verlobte seinem Bruder und dessen Frau vorstellt, staunen die nicht schlecht: Bianca ist eine lebensechte Puppe. Dass Lars seine Zukünftige als wunderschöne und vor allem lebendige Frau betrachtet, veranlasst Gus und Karin, die Ärztin Dr. Dagmar (Patricia Clarkson) zu konsultieren. Doch die hat eine kuriose Lösung für das Problem: Lars’ Umfeld soll Bianca als dessen Freundin akzeptieren und als neues, vollwertiges – und vor allem lebendiges Gemeindemitglied behandeln. Die seltsame Methode führt zu außergewöhnlichen Begegnungen, die Lars’ Leben Stück für Stück verändern.\nWissenswertes & Infos zu Lars und die Frauen\nCraig Gillespies schräge Komödie wurde bei den Oscars für das Beste Drehbuch, Ryan Gosling als Bester Hauptdarsteller für einen Golden Globe nominiert. Der Film kam beim Kinopublikum trotz sehr guter Kritiken nur mäßig an und wurde finanziell gesehen ein Flop.\n"

"70s movies","Suspiria - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","For other uses, see Suspiria (disambiguation).\n\nSuspiria (pronounced [susˈpi.ri.a], Latin for ""sighs"") is a 1977 Italian horror film directed by Dario Argento, co-written by Argento and Daria Nicolodi, and co-produced by Claudio and Salvatore Argento. The film stars Jessica Harper as an American ballet student who transfers to a prestigious dance academy in Germany but later realizes that the academy is a front for something far more sinister and supernatural amidst a series of murders. The film also features Stefania Casini, Flavio Bucci, Miguel Bosè, Alida Valli, Udo Kier, and Joan Bennett in her final film role. It is the first Dario Argento's horror film to have THX-certified audio and video.\nThe score was composed by progressive rock band Goblin and released in 1977. The film is the first of the trilogy Argento refers to as ""The Three Mothers"", followed in 1980 by Inferno and in 2007 by The Mother of Tears. Suspiria has become one of Argento's most successful feature films, receiv… \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspiria"
"Lsvl library movies","A brief history of time - 92","A Brief History of Time is based on cosmologist Stephen Hawking's 1988 bestseller of the same name. This anecdotal film concerns itself as much with Hawking's day-to-day life as it does with his unorthodox theories about the universe. Only the most close-minded viewer will be bothered by the ALS-suffering Hawking's physical appearance and his inability to move and speak without assistance (as narrator of the film, he utilizes a voice synthesizer, which he capriciously refers to as ""my American accent""). Director Errol Morris inventively adopts a semi-dramatized approach to his interviews with Hawking's friends and relatives: they all appear in fabricated sets, and are lovingly photographed and lit as if they were starring in a film. Though of necessity a ""talking heads"" effort, A Brief History of Time is also cunningly and subtly cinematic. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi\n\nG, 1 hr. 25 min.\nDocumentary, Special Interest"

"movies","Frances Ha","Frances Ha\nFrances Ha (2012), US , 86 min. , FSK 6\n\nvon Noah Baumbach, mit Greta Gerwig und Mickey Sumner\n\nGreta Gerwig spielt in Noah Baumbachs Großstadtmärchen Frances Ha eine aufstrebende Tänzerin, die lernen muss, erwachsen zu werden.\nDie 27-jährige Frances Halladay (Greta Gerwig) und ihre beste Freundin Sophie (Mickey Sumner) leben gemeinsam in einer Wohnung in New York City. Frances hat ihr Studium bereits vor einer Weile beendet, sucht nun jedoch nach einem Karrieresprungbrett, um sich als Tänzerin selbst verwirklichen zu können. So schlägt sie sich unter anderem als Tanzlehrerin durch. Mit ihrem Privatleben ist die lebenslustige Frances eigentlich ziemlich zufrieden, doch dann zieht ihre beste Freundin Sophie aus und gründet eine neue Wohngemeinschaft mit einer anderen Freundin in Tribeca. Frances bleibt allein zurück, zieht tänzelnd durch die Großstadt auf der Suche nach einer neuen Wohnung und nach einem neuen Platz in der großen weiten Welt. Wohin will sie und wie kann sie ihre ambitionierten Ziele erreichen?\nHintergrund & Infos zu Frances Ha\nNoah Baumbach (Greenberg) führte bei der Indie-Komödie Frances Ha Regie und beteiligte sich ebenfalls als Produzent. Gemeinsam mit der Hauptdarstellerin Greta Gerwig (To Rome with Love) entwickelte er das Skript zu dem Großstadtmärchen in Schwarz-Weiß. Während ihrer Arbeit an Frances Ha verliebten sich Noah Baumbauch und Greta Gerwig schließlich ineinander. Der 1969 in Brooklyn, New York City, geborene Noah Baumbach arbeitete zuvor bei einigen Filmprojekten eng mit seinem Kollegen Wes Anderson zusammen. Die beiden Filmemacher schrieben die Drehbücher zu Die Tiefseetaucher und Der fantastische Mr. Fox zusammen.\nFrances Ha feierte am 01. September 2012 Weltpremiere auf dem Telluride Film Festival. Im Februar 2013 wurde die Tragikomödie in der Kategorie Panorama Spezial auch auf den 63. Internationalen Filmfestspielen in Berlin gezeigt.\nDie Filmeltern von Frances Ha, die die Protagonistin in Sacramento besucht, sind auch im wahren Leben die Eltern der 1983 in Sacramento geborenen Hauptdarstellerin Greta Gerwig: Christine und Gordon Gerwig.

"movies","Sofia Coppola: The Bling Ring","The Bling Ring\nThe Bling Ring (2013), US , 91 min. , FSK 12\n\nvon Sofia Coppola, mit Emma Watson und Leslie Mann\n\nTHE BLING RING\nSie sind jung, sie sind wohlhabend, sie leben in Beverly Hills: Ihre Helden sind die Paris Hiltons, Lindsay Lohans und Kim Kardashians. Für sie zählen nur Glamour und der schöne Schein, die glitzernd-faszinierende Welt der Reichen und Schönen: The Bling Ring.\nFür die Clique um Nicki (Emma Watson), Rebecca (Katie Chang) und Marc (Israel Broussard) sind die Stars zum Greifen nahe. Die Teenager eifern ihren Idolen nicht nur nach, sie wollen in ihren Schuhen stecken, wortwörtlich! In immer haarsträubenderen und dreisteren Einbrüchen verschaffen sich die Teenager Zugang zu den Häusern der Stars. Anfangs ohne viel zu stehlen, mit der Zeit jedoch immer dreister und zwangsloser, mit immer mehr Andenken bestückt. Dass so viel kriminelle Sorglosigkeit nicht ohne Folgen bleiben kann, versteht sich von selbst. Bald rücken die jungen High Society-Diebe selbst ins Rampenlicht. Doch die Berühmtheit hat ihre ganz eigenen Regeln, was bald auch Rebecca und Nicki herausfinden…\nHintergrund & Infos zu The Bling Ring\nNachdem sich Sofia Coppola mit Lost in Translation und Somewhere mit den existentiellen Nöten des Startums beschäftigt hatte, betrachtet The Bling Ring das Thema von einer anderen Seite. Ins Zentrum rücken die Jünger des Starkultes, die die Leere des Jetsetlebens keineswegs als Manko, sondern als äußerst erstrebenswert ansehen. Um The Bling Ring die nötige Dosis Authentizität zu verschaffen, absolvierten Kirsten Dunst und Paris Hilton Gastauftritte im Film. Eine kleine Rolle hat auch Gavin Rossdale, der Sänger der Band Bush.\nThe Bling Ring beruht auf einem echten Kriminalfall, der 2008-2009 für Aufsehen sorgte. Dabei könnte Coppolas Film reelle Folgen für den Fall haben, da die Anwälte der angeklagten Teenager vorhaben, die Beteiligung von Ermittler Brett Goodkin als Ratgeber für The Bling Ring als Zeichen für mangelnde Glaubwürdigkeit zu benutzen und seine Aussage vor Gericht in Zweifel zu ziehen.

Rodada mientras esperaba para empezar a filmar su ambicioso biopic sobre Pablo Neruda protagonizado por Gael García Bernal, ‘El club’ promete ser una incendiaria diatriba contra la iglesia católica, con mucho humor negro “a lo griego” y ganas de levantar ampollas… y hasta estigmas. Una reflexión sobre la moral de la curia eclesiástica que parte de una estremecedora premisa comentada por el propio director: “la iglesia no cree en la justicia civil”. Estreno: 9 octubre."

"Lsvl library movies","Sonatine - 88","Acclaimed Japanese filmmaker, comedian, television star, author, and all-around renaissance man Takeshi ""Beat"" Kitano stars in this unconventional take on the crime drama. Kitano portrays Murakawa, a successful Yakuza officer who has grown weary of the violent life, so much so that he has even considered retirement. Thus, he is not pleased when he is asked to lead a team to help defuse a gang war in Okinawa but agrees when he is assured it will be an easy job. It proves anything but, however, and he soon finds himself in the middle of a complex, bloody conflict. Fearing that he has been set up, Murakawa withdraws to a nearby coastal town. The film takes a trademark Kitano turn at this point, moving away from the standard crime drama plot to focus on what amounts to a gangster's summer vacation, with the killers playing frisbee on the beach and taking dancing lessons. Murakawa even finds a summer romance, falling in love with a local girl who is impressed by his way with a gun. This sunny idyll cannot last forever, however, and soon the realities of the criminal life catch up with them. Seen as a prime example of Kitano's style, Sonatine features a combination of deadpan comedy and unexpectedly romantic lyricism, periodically interrupted by shockingly sudden bursts of violence. ~ Judd Blaise, Rovi\n\nR, 1 hr. 34 min.\nDrama, Action & Adventure, Art House & International, Mystery & Suspense"

"movies/series to watch - books to read","Trillium: quarterly updates - e lisa on missing data 7.12","7.12 ME\nI have updated Growth and income and added the table.  There are, however, no GIPS numbers on the fact sheet that I can see so I left that column hidden (pink = hidden).  \n\nAlso, on All cap core, there is no GIPS inception date in the column tab like the others and I do not see that on the fact sheet.\n7.12 ME\nI've removed the commentary links, updated the download link on the investment strategies table and made the GIPS section visible.\n\nThat's a lot of text for the GIPS header  here's a look:\nhttp://www.trilliuminvest.com/trillium-investment-strategies/large-cap-core/\n\n- is it possible to either:\n• add the GIPS inception to the list of facts above the table\n• make it GIPS* and put the date in the footer with a * (footer has no text in it at the moment)  Thoughts?\n7.12 LISA\n I just updated the performance charts in the Investment Strategy section.  Hopefully later today I’ll have the fact sheets ready to post, but not the commentary. Can you please remove the Commentary links as you did last quarter, until we have them ready.\n \nAlso, in the charts I’ve included the performance for the GIPS inception period.  That column doesn’t show up on the live site – can you make it appear?\n \nIn addition, for Growth and Income, can you include the rows that you do for the other strategies, and a performance chart?  The only time periods we have for that strategy is QTR, YTD, 1 Year and GIPS Inception 7/1/12.\n\nI posted all of the Q2 Fact Sheets.  However, I can’t figure out how to update the link to each fact sheet that is on the investment strategy page, can you do please? \n \nI’m on vacation next week. When you had the rows for Growth and Income, would you be able to populate them with the info – it’s on the Fact Sheet that I have posted.  Thanks."

When contacted by Phil, they would not assist in changing the administrative email contact from kevinhayes@earthlink.net.  Since you have an earthlink acct, we suggest the easiest route to be for you to try to create kevin's old email for yourself, test it to ensure it is working and let us know.  Alternate plan is for you to try and call as ken and see if they will talk to you. (There is no number on that site so you many have to start at aplus.net)  There are 3 places that email is listed - registrant contact, administrative contact, technical contact.  Please change them all if you are able to:\ndomain_transfer@philmorris.net  \n\nJulie"

La última “o la amas (Indiewire, Caimán CDC) o la odias (Positif, Cahiers du cinema)” del director griego Giorgos Lanthimos (‘Canino‘, ‘Alps’). ‘Langosta’ es una singular historia de amor ambientada en un futuro distópico donde las personas solteras son arrestadas y encerradas en un hotel donde deberán encontrar pareja en un plazo de 45 días. Si no lo hacen, serán transformadas en el animal que ellos elijan. Una extraña comedia romántica de ciencia ficción, rodada en inglés y con reparto de lujo: Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Ben Whishaw, Léa Seydoux, John C. Reilly y, no podía faltar, Aggeliki Papoulia, uno de los rostros más reconocibles del nuevo cine griego. Estreno: 6 noviembre."

The film is an account of the Bielski partisans, a group led by Polish Jewish brothers who saved and recruited Jews in Belarus during the Second World War. \n\nアザエルかっこいいーってなったのに、最後にソ連軍に入隊して戦死ってどないなん！？笑\nズシュとトヴィアがやっぱりかっこいい\nトヴィアだな、最後に愛を掴んで\n\n\nただ生きるだけであれば惨殺や殺戮がなければ生きられる。ただ、人間として生きるためには、抵抗しなければならない時があるんだ。\nそれが戦時中で理不尽で不条理な条件下であればいかに難しく困難になるか。そこをあくまで人間らしく生きることに執着し、生きることを放棄したくなった時に支えてくれる家族や仲間がトヴィアにはいた。その仲間はトヴィアが今までしてきた行動から絆が生まれた。\n人間らしく生きるためには、周りに抵抗しなければならず、つらいこと、逃げ出したいこと、それらにも「抵抗」しなければならない時がある。\n\n独裁が全て悪いわけではない。ナチスに追われていたトヴィアも、コミュニティを維持するためにとっていた政治形態は「独裁」であった。\nコミュニティの一人を射殺するシーンがそれを表している。ただ、それは「ルール」に従わなかったからであり、「ルール」違反すると殺される罰が与えられる可能性があるのは今の世界でも同じ。「ルール」は柔軟でもあるべきなときがあり、妊娠を禁止していたが、トヴィアはそのルールを柔軟に変更していた。「独裁」であるが独裁ではなかった。\n"

For the song, see Ill Manors (song).\n\nIll Manors (stylised as ill Manors) is a British crime drama film written, co-scored and directed by Plan B. The film revolves around the lives of eight main characters, played by Riz Ahmed, Ed Skrein, Keith Coggins, Lee Allen, Nick Sagar, Ryan De La Cruz, Anouska Mond and Natalie Press, and features six original songs by Plan B, which act as a narration for the film. Ill Manors is a multi-character story, set over the course of seven days, a scenario where everyone is fighting for respect. The film focuses on eight core characters, and their circles of violence, as they struggle to survive on the streets. Each story weaves into one another, painting an ultra-realistic gritty picture of the world which is on the brink of self-destruction. Each story is also represented by a different rap song performed by Plan B.\n\nContents\n [hide] 1 Plot\n2 Cast\n3 Production\n4 Release\n5 Reception\n6 Soundtrack... \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ill_Manors"

For other uses, see Twin Peaks (disambiguation).\n\nTwin Peaks is an American television serial drama created by Mark Frost and David Lynch. It follows an investigation headed by FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) into the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). Its pilot episode was first broadcast on April 8, 1990, on ABC. Seven more episodes were produced, and the series was renewed for a second season that aired until June 10, 1991. The show's title comes from the small, fictional Washington town in which it is set.\nTwin Peaks became one of the top-rated shows of 1990 and was a critical success both nationally and internationally. It captured a devoted cult fan base and became a part of popular culture that has been referenced in television shows, commercials, comic books, video games, films and song lyrics. Declining viewer ratings led to ABC's insistence that the identity of Laura's murderer be revealed midway t... \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks"

"movies to see","the wolfpack","For practically their entire lives, the six Angulo brothers lived within the confines of their apartment in a housing project in New York City. According to director Crystal Moselle’s profound documentary about their family, which won the U.S. Documentary Grand Jury Prize at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, their Peruvian father forbade them (and their American mother) from stepping foot into the city. But he did allow them to rent movies, and the brothers devoured them so fully, they began to re-create their favorites using a camcorder and a surprisingly resourceful DIY approach to costumes and props. Moselle uses those films and her own fly-on-the-wall cinematography to create an indelible portrait of how cinema shaped and rescued these six lost boys."

"movies to see","going clear","The Church of Scientology has been a subject of deep fascination and frustration for decades, but no one has ever attempted as probing and thorough a feature documentary on the Church until this film by Alex Gibney (Taxi to the Dark Side), based on investigative journalist Lawrence Wright’s book of the same name. Anyone who has followed the Church is likely familiar with many of the Scientology buzzwords used here (body theatans, Xenu, the Sea-Org, e-meters, etc.), as well as with the major players in the Church featured in the doc (L. Ron Hubbard, David Miscavige, Tom Cruise, John Travolta, etc.) Anyone even casually familiar with the Church is also likely not surprised by its full-throated repudiation of the film. Gibney and Wright, however, push their gaze further inside the Church with a deliberate and mesmerizing urgency, making a devastating case for how damaging life in the Church has been for so many who have chosen to leave it."

When the Vice President of the United States unexpectedly dies, all eyes in Washington D.C. are on President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) as he chooses a new VP. Sen. Jack Hathaway (William Petersen), a respected career politician enjoying a new swell of popularity after a well-publicized attempt to save a drowning woman, is expected to be Evans' choice, but instead he picks Sen. Laine Hanson (Joan Allen), a decision that raises eyebrows on both sides of the political fence. Veteran power broker Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) is vehemently opposed to Hanson's appointment, in part because the Democratic senator was once a Republican, and vows to do everything in his power to prevent her from being confirmed. Runyon and his staff start digging for dirt on Hanson, and soon make a surprising discovery -- her personal morality is called into question when it's alleged that she took part in a group sexual liaison while she was a college student. The Contender also stars Mike Binder as one of Hanson's advisors, Mariel Hemingway as an old friend with a surprising secret, Christian Slater as an ambitious congressmen assisting Runyon, and Philip Baker Hall as Hanson's father; it was the second feature from former film critic Rod Lurie."

Lions Gate spent a further $8 million on distribution and marketing.[4] The film ultimately grossed $55 million worldwide (including $30 million from the North American box office alone).[5]\nBefore filming began, the Lonergans' experience was re-created for an episode of ABC's 20/20, and the segment was repeated after the release of Open Water.

For those who are unfamiliar with Thiel, he’s one of the founders of Paypal, an early investor in Facebook and the inspiration for the Peter Gregory character on the first season of HBO’s Silicon Valley. I didn’t agree with everything in the book, but you can tell the guy has a very unique mind for business. He makes you think, which is about all you can ask for from a non-fiction book.

"gay movie","Any Day Now  (チョコレートドーナツ)","認められない愛なんてあるべきではなし、そもそも存在しない。なぜなら、愛は愛するひとと愛されるひとの間にしか存在し得ないのだから。そこに「ある」ことは愛するひとと愛されるひとにしかわからないのだから。\n認められない愛なんてないとわかっているのに、愛を評価してしまうからつらいのだろう。私も、愛を評価しているんだろう、無意識に。\n\n法律は人を守るべきものなのに、人を幸せにするためにあるべきものなのに、時に人をどうしようもなく傷つけ、人をどうしようもなく不幸にする。法律を知れば知るほど、法律があるべき本来の姿や役割を見失うのかもしれない。本当の自分を解き放ち、自由に、ありのままに生きている者であれば、見失わないものなのに。\n\nAny Day Now is a 2012 American drama film directed by Travis Fine who rewrote the original screenplay that George Arthur Bloom had written 30 years previously.\nBloom describes the extraordinary story behind getting the movie made: ""The screenplay for Any Day Now was inspired by a true story – not based on a true story. I wrote the original script 30 years ago. A friend of mine in NY introduced me to a gay man named Rudy. Rudy lived on Atlantic Ave in Brooklyn. At that time, Atlantic Ave was pretty rundown. It has been gentrified since then. Rudy lived in a tiny apartment and had very little money. He befriended a 12-year-old boy who lived a few blocks away. The boy had been abandoned by his druggie/prostitute mother, and lived with his grandmother. The grandmother didn’t do much to provide for the boy, who didn’t speak. I’m guessing he was Autistic, but there was no money to do anything about it. Rudy would bring the boy to his apartment, see to it that he was properly clothed and fed, and he did what he could to get him into school. He practically raised him. That is where reality ended and my writer’s imagination took over. After spending time with Rudy and the boy, I got to wondering what would happen if Rudy decided to adopt him. I did my research and spoke to a number of people about the problems a gay man would have adopting a boy. Remember, this was 1980. The times were a lot different then, although we still have a long way to go. Several months later I had a screenplay.""\n\nDespite having a compelling story, Bloom would have to wait 32 years to actually see the movie made. He explains: ""My son, PJ, is one of the top Music Supervisors in LA, as well as a record producer and publisher. Among other shows, PJ is the Music Supervisor on GLEE. Travis Fine, the director of Any Day Now, made another independent movie 3 years ago called THE SPACE BETWEEN. Travis and PJ were friends in high school. When Travis needed help with the music on his movie he contacted PJ. When the movie was done, Travis told PJ he was looking for another movie to do, something small, with heart, and about something important. PJ, who has known about my script his entire adult life, told Travis the story. Travis loved it, and asked that I send him the screenplay. I did, and he said he wanted to make it, with the caveat that he could do some rewriting. We discussed that, and I agreed. Travis did his rewrite, raised the money, hired the actors, and made the movie. If you discount the first 30 years of trying to get the movie made, the last couple have gone by quickly. I love everything Travis did to the script, and he’s made a marvelous movie. He changed the boy who didn’t speak to a boy with Down Syndrome, and cast an extraordinary Down Syndrome actor to play the part. Travis made several other significant changes, but the heart and soul of my screenplay remain as the anchor to the movie."" "

"25 sci fi movies","4. The Congress","This film may be one of the most overseen masterpieces of science fiction ever. The Congress is an Israeli-French film done by Ari Folman and starring Robin Wright that one could call ‘Citizen Kane on psychedelic drugs’. In no way is the plot similar to Citizen Kane, but its attack on the rulers of Hollywood who abuse their power does bring back memories of the social impact that Orson Welle’s classic had on the public.\n\nIn the movie, Robin Wright, who plays herself in the movie, gives her DNA to a production company called Miramount so she no longer has to act and can simply let an advanced algorithm provide her with a cinematic avatar. The film transcends into a lush, animated landscape when Robin Wright ultimately revisits the studio she sold her DNA to in order to renew her contract and speak at the Futorological Congress, which is also the name of the book that the movie is based on.\n\nWhat ensues is one of the most intriguing and rewarding final acts in a movie. With an ensemble cast, mesmerizing animation, and a beautifully meta-layered story, The Congress might forever be diamond in the rough of science fiction history, but its brilliance is undeniable.\n"

Después de su repercusión en el Atlántida Film Fest, el debut como directora de la anglo-estadounidense de origen iraní Ana Lily Amirpour se estrena en salas comerciales. Y no es de extrañar. Aunque ya hablamos de ella durante el festival, este hipnótico y atmosférico western de vampiros, hablado en persa y con música de White Lies, no podía faltar en esta selección. El primer mordisco de una directora que ya está afilando los colmillos para el segundo: ‘The Bad Batch’, una historia de amor y canibalismo financiada por Megan Ellison, la productora estrella del Hollywood más indie (‘Spring Breakers’, ‘La noche más oscura’, ‘Her‘). Estreno: 4 septiembre.\n\nEl argumento: En la ciudad iraní de Bad City puede pasar cualquier cosa. En medio de un abanico de personajes marginales, un vampiro vaga en busca de sangre. Al western vampírico se le suma un romance teñido de sangre. La cinta combina géneros y estilos; invoca el western, la fascinación propia de Lynch, el terror y las novelas gráficas.\n\nConviene ver: “Una chica vuelve a casa sola de noche” es una cinta iraní con protagonista vampira que pasó por Sundance y Sitges dejando opiniones diversas.  El film tiene una estética bastante lograda. Es en blanco y negro, lo que da otro toque a la historia. No hace falta mucho para quedar enganchado, aun cuando los diálogos no son abundantes, sobretodo en el caso de la protagonista. La vampira vaga por las noches buscando víctimas, pero no son al azar, sabe muy bien con la vida de quien debe acabar y un día en su camino se cruza un chico con una historia familiar complicada, surgiendo entre los dos una relación especial que se va intensificando por momentos, aunque a simple vista el espectador pueda no darse cuenta. Película sencilla pero intensa, de las que no importa repetir visionado y que sabe mezclar denuncia política y social con una bien equilibrada y adictiva mezcla de géneros.\n\nConviene saber: La cinta está dirigida y escrita por Ana Lily Amirpour.\n\nLa crítica le da un CINCO"

Fogueado en televisión (en las series de Ryan Murphy ‘Glee’ y ‘American Horror Story‘), el tejano Alfonso Gomez-Rejon debutó el año pasado en el cine con ‘The Town That Dreaded Sundown’, una de las mejores relecturas del género slasher vistas en mucho tiempo (y de la que, si sigue sin estrenarse, hablaremos con más detenimiento en nuestro especial de Halloween). Con su segunda película, ‘Yo, él y Raquel’ (cuyo título original es bastante más expresivo: ‘Me and Earl and the Dying Girl’), ha logrado poner de acuerdo a todo un festival: Mejor película y Premio del Público en Sundance. Una historia de iniciación, cinefilia y amor trágico que promete ser la ‘Whiplash‘ de este año. Se podrá ver en el festival de San Sebastián. Estreno: 9 octubre."
"� movies","Son of Saúl","‘Son of Saul’ (László Nemes)\n\n\nUna de las sensaciones del último festival de Cannes. El debut del húngaro László Nemes, quien hasta ahora había sido ayudante de dirección de Béla Tarr en ‘El hombre de Londres’, fue junto a ‘Carol‘ y ‘The Assassin’ (y mal que le pese a Boyero, que no se enteró de nada), la película mejor recibida por la crítica que asistió al festival (no por casualidad ganó el premio FIPRESCI, que lo otorga la crítica, además del Gran Premio del Jurado). Cuando parecía que ya estaba todo dicho sobre el Holocausto, o por lo menos en su forma de representarlo, Nemes llega para saltarse todo tipo de convencionalismos y proponer algo nuevo: una experiencia física en el corazón del horror, una inmersión en las profundidades de Auschwitz a través del seguimiento a un sonderkommando (colaboracionista judío). ¿El próximo Oscar a la mejor película de habla no inglesa? Estreno: 4 diciembre."

In gambling parlance, a ""cooler"" is an unlucky individual whose presence at the tables results in a streak of bad luck for the other players.\n\nContents\n [hide] 1 Plot\n2 Cast\n3 Production\n4 Critical reception\n5 Awards and nominations\n6 References\n7 External links\n\nPlot[edit]\nUnlucky Bernie Lootz (William H. Macy) has little going for him: He lives in a dreary studio apartment in a rundown motel on the Las Vegas Strip, he's indebted to Shangri-La casino boss Shelly Kaplow (Alec Baldwin), who years earlier cured him of a gambling habit by destroying his kneecap, and he can't recall the last time he had physical contact with a woman. His success as a ""cooler"" is jeopardized when cocktail waitress Natalie Belisario (Maria Bello) seemingly takes an interest in him, and his luck — and that of those around him — takes a turn for the better.

For the girls, getting it into their food at any opportunity may be best, as it might be nearly impossible to get them to swallow it the way an adult would.  I'll send a recipe for a simple garlic soup to your inbox that may help with getting the garlic going.  Regarding botanicals, I would go with gentle herbs like Elder, specifically an Elderberry syrup because it is anti-viral.  Gaia Herbs makes a great syrup, available at health food stores.  The syrup can be taken frequently and is safe for both Eli and Glory.  As far as controlling any mucus, you can use VERY low doses of Goldenseal in children (I'm talking 3 - 5 drops under the tongue, 3x per day).  Goldenseal should not be used for more than three days.  Instead of Bloodroot as an expectorant, go with a gentler herb such as Licorice in the tea form.  It is sweet, can be drank frequently throughout the day, and will keep their adrenal glands supported.  Hope this helps!"

"25 sci fi movies","18. Super 8","Following the success of Cloverfield and Star Trek, director, J.J. Abrams and his production company, Bad Robot, decided to create this nostalgic masterpiece. Super 8 was produced by the master of the ‘summer blockbuster’ himself, Steven Spielberg.\n\nThe movie draws elements from classics like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T., but does so with a modernized reverence for these kinds of films. It also uses modern cinematic technicalities, effects, and plot devices that help revitalize the genre. Super 8 may be just one of the films In Abrams’ amazing filmography, but before he was working in a ‘galaxy far, far away’, he was reminiscing on the sci-fi classics of old with Super 8.\n"

"25 sci fi movies","14. Serenity","A spin-off film of the beloved, yet short-lived series, Firefly, Serenity opened in 2005 to positive reviews. Although it didn’t make back its budget until its home video release, the film is incredible in that it takes an extremely intricate universe and makes it appealing for novices instead of just ‘brown-coats’ (Firefly fans).\n\nFirefly was one of Joss Whedon’s first efforts, and opened the door for him to the recognition and success he’s gotten to today. Serenity is also one of Whedon’s first cinematic outings, which helped his reputation in the movie world to get him to the ‘king of Comic-Con’ role he carries in the present.\n\nSerenity will always be a beloved sci-fi film of the post 2000’s not only because of it’s die-hard fan base, but also because of its perfectly light atmosphere that opens up the viewing demographic for the film to those besides devoted ‘brown-coats’.\n"
"25 sci fi movies","15. Coherence","As James Ward Bykit’s directorial debut, Coherence serves as an experiment with a great result in minimalistic science fiction. The film focuses mostly on dialogue, but has a dark and challenging plotline that emphasizes parallel universes and ‘coherence’, a state of reality where other realities can seamlessly intersect with one another.\n\nEerie in tone, yet brilliant and thought-provoking in story, Coherence is easily not just one of the best science fiction films of the post 2000’s, but one of the best movies of the recent years in general.\n"

Producida por la factoría Blumhouse (‘Insidious‘, ‘Sinister’, ‘Paranormal Activity’), la película ha sido calificada como una sorprendente y muy hábil mezcla entre el cine de Haneke y los thrillers-asusta-parejas-WASP que hicieron furor en los 90 tipo ‘De repente, un extraño’ (1990), ‘La mano que mece la cuna’ (1992) o ‘Falsa seducción’ (1992).

Прихожанин делится с Джеймсом своими размышлениями о том, что на гибель плохого священника никто и не обратит внимания, тогда как убийство хорошего может заставить общество задуматься. С этими словами он даёт святому отцу неделю на то, чтобы привести в порядок дела, после чего Джеймс будет убит. Однако вместо того, чтобы начинать готовиться к смерти или обратиться в полицию, в отпущенный срок священник занимается обычными повседневными делами, стараясь изменить жизнь своих прихожан к лучшему. \nhttp://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/666951/"

"Banjomovies Reality","Porno en de efteling","Efteling loopins.nl gezeik. \nUitleggen dat we naar de efteling gingen en een munt kregen voor de baron... OKEUH. Boeit niet.\nEen avondje zuipen in de efteling met mede YouTubers (foto) kan jen onmoggelijk weigeren. Helemaal als Pardoes (foto diana) ook aan komt schuiven voor een ''x''' aantal biertjes.... Die pardoes hebben we gewoon dronken in carnival gegooid; geloof me de 1e 3 uur is dat grappig; maar daarna ben je er ook wel klaar mee met je dronken hoofd.\nIn ieder geval; het was gezellig met youtubers.\nDe efteling gaf ons allemaal deze munt om de Baron 1898 uit te gaan testen; 's werelds 8e skydive... Persoonlijk zeg ik liever 's werelds 1e  skydive in Nederland!\nMet deze munt mag je gratis het park in en je mag de lijn overslaan om de Baron 1898 binnen te gaan.. ok. boeit me weer niet. Ik woon in Deventer.. de efteling is in totaal 5 uur reizen; dat is langer dan dat ik in dat park zou zijn.\nToch verschenen er artikels over en het erge is............ DIE VERVLOEKTE KANKER FOTO. Sophie; Diana en Rutger kijken gewoon vriendelijk zo van 'leuk dat je er bent' waar Bardo achterblijft aals vieze Barry en zo vlak naast de Schrik Rick met in de hoek Defano die niet echt blij lijkt.. Het was een leuke busrit :D\nHelemaal omdat de auto nog eens vast kwam te zitten in een geppel langs de weg.. Ik ben nergens te vinden op de foto lololololollololol\nIn ieder geval waren veel mensen niet blij met de youtubers die langs kkwamen (2/3 reacties voorlezen) 4e reactie: Oh ja. BBardo zou wel mogen komen!..... ZE HEBBEN ME NIET GEZIEN OP DE FOTO!!! "":D Ik hou van lang haar. -> Reactie later ''bardo staat er wel bij hoor'' oh kutje... tegen camera; jullie zijn verraders.\nIk snap dat ze boos zijn we praten hier over pretpar fanaten die de houden van de ervaring en laten  we eerlijk wezen de wachtrij bij de efteling is een ervaring die wil je niet missen; daarom zal ik ookk extra langzaam naar binnen lopen wanneer ik ooit deze munt ga inleveren; gewoon rustig vliegen en genieten van alle ruimte terwijl iedereen daar opgepropt in de rij nog mag wachten!\nEn dan denk je dat het over is; maar nee! Ik heb een joker in mijn hand namelijk; Dennis!! Onze ggehandicapte vriend. We nemen hem mee naar de efteling en vlak voor elke attractie die we binnen gaan durft hij plotseling niet meer en ga ik wel weer ipv hem zitten... zo ben ik dan ook wel weer.\nMocht je meer willen zien van alle Youtubers die er waren dan kan ik je aanraden om de insta van Kelvin te checken; hij heeft letterlijk met iedereen die er was een foto genomen... respect.. (applaus)\n\nik ben een partypoeper..\n\nhttp://gyazo.com/c5335bc84016bf005ecf38670e8ef749\nhttp://www.looopings.nl/weblog/3394/Efteling-laat-Nederlandse-YouTube-sterren-voordringen-bij-dive-coaster-Baron-1898.html\n pic.twitter.com/z6NkcAheFC\npic.twitter.com/GiCIhRUwI4\npic.twitter.com/tN2MTostpT\npic.twitter.com/GlVa8dlbeA\npic.twitter.com/rL1719qzJz\n\nDan nu Martin. In het zonnetje zetten. Hij is namelijk de dupe. Dames opgelet.\nHij heeft zichzelf namelijk op sexmarkt.nl gezet. Zegmaar marktplaats waar je geen spullen aanbied maar je hele lichaam.\nDit kan je doen in ruil voor van alles; hoogfstwaarschijnlijkk geld. Maar anders kan je net als (...) een oproep plaatsen dat je opzoek bent naar iphone om aan je zoontje op zijn verjaardag te geven.. HAHAHAHAHAHAH. Of als (..) dat je ramen gelapt moeten worden.. serieus? Ga dan voor een iphone.\nIn ieder geval; sexmarkt.nl bied je alles aan wat je in het leven zoekt. Ze hebben cateorieen voor alles; vrouwen; mannen; stellen;'gay; shemaels; sexclubs; natura; sexjobs bdsm etc.\nMocht je nou rare gevoelens krijgen op vreemde plekken; dan hebben ze bij sexmarkt.nl een categorie ervoor. Dus ook voor Martin.\nHij heet niet echt Martin; want als ik zou zeggen dat hij eigenlijk Elroy heel vind ik dat zo lullig voor die beste man. Alhoewel hij er zelf om gevraagd heeft; want je zet niet je naam onder een sex advertentie. Je verzint een gruwelijke pornonaam; en Elroy.. dat is nou niet een gruwelijke porno naam.\nIn ieder geval is '''martin'' blind en zou graagg een keer seks willen hebben. Hiervoor heeft hij een advertentie geplaatst; voorlezen.\nMAAR HIJ IS BLIND!! Hij moet geholpen zijn met deze advertentie; wat al redelijk ongemakelijk is. Dan vertrouw je iemand. Je hoopt dat iemand dit geheim kan houden zodat jij een keer in je leven het grote mensenwerk mmag gaan verrichten; je dolfijn laten genieten van een verse oester.\nAlleen arme Martin... Zijn vriend heeft aangekruisd dat hij ook anaal wil ontvangen. En dan praat ik niet over iemand ontvangen bij deur.. zo van; ''kom binnen''. of ja... kom binnen.. tot op zekere hooggte wel..\nhttp://www.sexmarkt.nl/advertentie/129506/opzoek-naar-een-vrouw\nhttp://www.sexmarkt.nl/advertentie/197156/bijles\n\nhttp://www.sexmarkt.nl/advertentie/230269/sex-voor-diverse-goederen\n\nhttp://www.sexmarkt.nl/advertentie/227907/hoertje-zoekt-rijles...\n\nhttp://www.sexmarkt.nl/advertentie/176198/welke-man-wil-deze-volle-vrouw---helpen-"

"movie","模仿遊戲 The imitation Game","8發人深省，\n再次看到在二戰期間發生的事，\n就像是星際效應般，\n總是有一個這麼不特別的存在，\n不normal從小被欺負，\n對某事物一部份特別有所堅持，\n也超乎常人的敏銳和聰穎。\n附加的他可能難以相處、性向也和大眾不同！\n我相信電影中的現代電腦之父Alan Turing 只是一個我們比較可接受的例子，他對於世人的貢獻我們難以想像。COMPUTER\n但世界有那麼簡單嗎？都是那麼令人惋惜？\n電影中的名言「被世人遺棄的人，才能成就讓人想像不到的大事」\n\n畫面精緻，家具擺設相當雅緻。\n\n又是一部提到希特勒萬歲帶給人類的破壞，人當中就是也有這樣的存在，像IS也是持續在做著我們無法理解的事，此趟歐洲之旅，真當好好了解，走訪這些人事已非之景。\n\n還有在戲中希望妻子瓊逃亡，不要再和他在一起，因為關心。不禁讓我感受這份感動，家人就是這樣，無條件接納，只是因為關心彼此，而希望一直陪在身旁。"

Jackson ORDELL ROBBIE\nRobert Forster MAX CHERRY\nBridget Fonda MELANIE\n\nJACKIE BROWN\nIn Quentin Tarrantinos Heist Krimi soll die Stewardess Jackie Brown für Waffenhändler Samuel L. Jackson Bargeld schmuggeln – doch der einfache Plan ist komplizierter als gedacht.\nDie Stewardess Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) bessert ihr schmales Gehalt dadurch auf, daß sie im Auftrag des kleinen Waffenhändlers Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) illegal Bargeld in die USA einführt – bis sie eines Tages am Flughafen von Los Angeles von Special Agent Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) kontrolliert und festgenommen wird. Die Behörden setzen sie unter Druck: Jackie wird nur dann straffrei ausgehen, wenn sie aktiv mithilft, Ordell auffliegen zu lassen. Mit Hilfe des sympathischen Kautionsvermittlers Max Cherry (Robert Forster), der sich nur zu gut in ihre Lage hineinversetzen kann, heckt Jackie einen gewagten, tollkühnen Plan aus, um die verschiedenen Seiten gegeneinander auszuspielen. Noch vertrackter wird die Situation durch Ordells Komplizen Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) und Melanie Ralston (Bridget Fonda), die ihre eigenen Ziele verfolgen. Indem sie vorgibt, sowohl mit den Gangstern als auch mit den Fahndern zu kooperieren, versucht Jackie Brown, alle Beteiligten übers Ohr zu hauen und nicht weniger als eine halbe Million Dollar in ihre eigene Tasche wandern zu lassen…\nHintergrund & Infos zu Jackie Brown\nJackie Brown ist eine Adaption des Romans Rum Punch von Elmore Leonard. Der Autor selbst nennt den Film die beste Adaption eines seiner Bücher, von denen es mittlerweile immerhin schon einige gibt, darunter Todeszug nach Yuma, Schnappt Shorty und Out of Sight. Letzterer hat mit Ray Nicolet sogar eine Figur, die auch in Jackie Brown vorkommt und in beiden Filmen von Michael Keaton dargestellt wurde. Die Hauptfigur Jackie nannte Quentin Tarantino von Burke in Brown um und machte aus ihr statt einer Weißen eine Afro-Amerikanerin, weil er unbedingt Pam Grier für diese Rolle haben wollte.\n\n"
