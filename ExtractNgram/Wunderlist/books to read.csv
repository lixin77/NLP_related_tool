"Books to read","What makes Sammy Run","What Makes Sammy Run by Budd Schulberg. A composite figure based on some of Hollywood’s first moguls, the book chronicles the rise and fall of Sammy Glick, the rags-to-riches boy from New York who makes his way through deception and betrayal. Essentially, Sammy is your Ari Gold without the slightest bit of human decency. He’s running from self-reflection, from meaning. It’s fear knocking on the door that he’s frantically trying to block with accomplishments. Sammy is an accomplished man, but not a great man — that takes ethics, purpose, and principles. All The King’s Men by Robert Penn Warren is another similar story — a sort of fictional version of The Power Broker — that tells of the effect that power and drive can have."
"Books to read","The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz","The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz by Mordecai Richler. Duddy is the ultimate Jewish hustler, always working, always scheming, always looking for a deal, and looked down upon by everyone for his limitless ambition. Duddy never stops in his pursuit to acquire real estate in order to “be somebody” — never forgetting his grandfather’s maxim that “a man without land is nobody.” Except it doesn’t work out like he planned. From this book, you learn that the hustler — the striver — if he cannot prioritize and if he does not have principles, loses everything in the end."
"Books to read","The Power Broker","The Power Broker by Robert A. Caro. It took me 15 days to read all 1,165 pages of this monstrosity that chronicles the rise of Robert Moses. I was 20 years old. It was one of the most magnificent books I’ve ever read. Moses built just about every other major modern construction project in New York City. The public couldn’t stop him, the mayor couldn’t stop him, the governor couldn’t stop him, and only once could the President of the United States stop him. But ultimately, you know where the cliché must take us. Robert Moses was an asshole. He may have had more brain, more drive, more strategy than other men, but he did not have more compassion. And ultimately power turned him into something monstrous."
"Books to read","The 48 Laws of Power","The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene. It is impossible to describe this book and do it justice. But if you plan on living life on your terms, climbing as high as you’d like to go, and avoid being controlled by others, then you need to read this book. Robert is an amazing researcher and storyteller — he has a profound ability to explain timeless truths through story and example. You can read the classics and not always understand the lessons. But if you read the The 48 Laws, I promise you will leave not just with actionable lessons but an indelible sense of what to do in many trying and confusing situations. As a young person, one of the most important laws to master is to “always say less than necessary.” Always ask yourself: “Am I saying this because I want to prove how smart I am or am I saying this because it needs to be said?” Don’t forget The Prince, The Art of War, and all the other required readings in strategy. And of course, it doesn’t matter how good you are at the game of power, without Mastery it’s worthless."
"Books to read","Lord Chrsterfield's Letters","Lord Chesterfield’s Letters by Lord Chesterfield. Just like Meditations, which was never intended for publication, this is a private correspondence between Lord Chesterfield and his son Philip. We should probably be happy that this guy was not our father — but we can be glad that his wisdom has been passed down. I have not marked as many pages in a book as I have in this one in quite some time. Of course, the classic in this genre of letters is Letters From A Self Made Merchant To His Son. Dating back to 1890, these are preserved letters from John “Old Gorgon” Graham, a self-made millionaire in Chicago, and his son who is coming of age and entering the family business. His letters are an incisive and edifying tutorial in entrepreneurship, responsibility, and leadership. Rilke’s Letters To A Young Poet is also moving and profound. Addressed to a 19-year-old former student of his who sought Rilke’s critique, these short letters are less concerned with poetry and more about what it means to live a meaningful and fulfilling life as an artist and as a person."
"Books to read","Empire State of mind: How Jay-Z went form Street corner to Corner Office","Empire State of Mind: How Jay-Z Went from Street Corner to Corner Office by Zack O’Malley Greenburg. This is a biography that also functions as a business book. It shows how as a young man in Brooklyn, Jay applied hustling techniques to the music business and eventually built his empire. A true hustler, he never did only one thing — from music to fashion to sports, Jay dominated each field, always operating on the same principles. As he puts it, “I’m not a businessman, I’m a business, man!” And related to that, I also recommend The 50th Law, which tells the stories of many such individuals and will stick with you just as long."
"Books to read","What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars","What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars by Jim Paul and Brendan Moynihan. There are lots of books on aspiring to something. Very little are from actual people who aspired, achieved, and lost it. With each and every successful move that he made, Jim Paul, who made it to Governor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, was convinced that he was special, different, and exempt from the rules. Once the markets turned against his trades, he lost it all — his fortune, job, and reputation. That’s what makes this book a critical part in understanding how letting arrogance and pride get to your head is the beginning of your unraveling. Learn from stories like this instead of by your own trial and error. Think about that next time you believe you have it all figured out. (Tim Ferriss recently produced the audiobook version of this, which I recommend.)"
"Books to read","The Autobiography of Malcom X: As Told to Alex Haley","The Autobiography of Malcolm X: As Told to Alex Haley by Malcolm X. I forget who said it but I heard someone say that Catcher in the Rye was to young white boys what The Autobiography of Malcolm X was to young black boys. Personally, I prefer that latter over the former. I would much rather read about and emulate a man who is born into adversity and pain, struggles with criminality, does prison time, teaches himself to read through the dictionary, finds religion, and then becomes an activist for Civil Rights before being gunned down by his former supporters when he tempers the hate and anger that had long defined parts of his message. Booker T. Washington’s memoir Up from Slavery and Frederick Douglass’s epic narrative are both incredibly moving and inspiring as well."
"Books to read","The Kid stays in the Picture: A Notorious life","The Kid Stays in the Picture: A Notorious Life by Robert Evans. If you’re specifically looking to make your way in showbiz, this is the book you have to read. It’s the rags-to-riches, rise and fall and rise of Robert Evans, one of the most notorious figures in Hollywood. From pants salesman to running Paramount Pictures (and producing The Godfather), his story is the one that everyone who heads to L.A. hopes to have. It was one of the first books I read when I started working in the business. I think it shows you how far hustle and hype and heat contribute to success. And how they can also lead to your downfall and exile."
"Books to read","The Disenchanted","The Disenchanted by Budd Schulberg and The Crack Up & The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The Disenchanted and The Crack Up are both about the fall of F. Scott Fitzgerald, one from the first person perspective and the other from the fictional eyes of a friend watching his hero fall to pieces — just like the story of Gatsby itself. The Crack Up is a collection of essays, many of which are off-topic, but they had to be — a person cannot look so directly and honestly on their own broken soul without turning away at times. Fitzgerald’s Crack Up has always been illustrative to me and it’s something I’ve thought a lot about. I call it the Second Act Fallacy, and you pity and feel for a man with so much talent and wisdom who was helpless to apply it to himself."

"Books to read","Steal like an Artist","Steal Like An Artist by Austin Kleon. Part of ambition is modeling yourself after those you’d like to be like. Austin’s philosophy of ruthlessly stealing and remixing the greats might sound appalling at first but it is actually the essence of art. You learn by stealing, you become creative by stealing, you push yourself to be better by working with these materials. Austin is a fantastic artist, but most importantly he communicates the essence of writing and creating art better than anyone else I can think of. It is a manifesto for any young, creative person looking to make his mark. Pair up with Show Your Work which is also excellent."
"Books to read","Status Anxiety","Status Anxiety by Alain de Botton. Ah yes, the drive that we all have to be better, bigger, have more, be more. Ambition is a good thing, but it’s also a source of great anxiety and frustration. In this book, philosopher Alain de Botton studies the downsides of the desire to “be somebody” in this world. How do you manage ambition? How do you manage envy? How do you avoid the traps that so many other people fall into? This book is a good introduction into the philosophy and psychology of just that."
"Books to read","THe Book of Five Rings","The Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi. Widely held as a classic, this book is much more than a manifesto and manual on swordsmanship and martial arts. It’s about the mindset, the discipline, and the perception necessary to win in life or death situations. As a swordsman, Musashi fought mostly by himself, for himself. His wisdom, therefore, is mostly internal. He tells you how to out-think and out-move your enemies. He tells you how to fend for yourself and live by a code. And isn’t that precisely what so many of us need help with every day?"
"Books to read","Meditations","Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. I would call this the greatest book ever written. It is the definitive text on self-discipline, personal ethics, humility, self-actualization, and strength. Bill Clinton reads it every year, and so have countless other leaders, statesmen, and soldiers. It is a book written by one of the most powerful men who ever lived on the lessons that power, responsibility, and philosophy teach us. This book will make you a better person and better able to manage the success you desire."
"Books to read","Titan","Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr. by Ron Chernow. I found Rockefeller to be strangely stoic, incredibly resilient, and, despite his reputation as a robber baron, humble and compassionate. Most people get worse as they get successful, many more get worse as they age. In fact, Rockefeller began tithing his money with his first job and gave more of it away as he became successful. He grew more open-minded the older he became, more generous, more pious, more dedicated to making a difference. And what made Rockefeller stand apart as a young man was his ability to remain cool-headed in adversity and grounded in success, always on an even keel, never letting excessive passion and emotion hold sway over him."
"Books to read","Personal History","Personal History by Katharine Graham. If one thing is certain about your path to success, it is that it will be fraught with adversity. Fate will intervene in ways you would never expect. Which is why you absolutely must read Graham’s memoir. After the tragic suicide of her husband, who ran the The Washington Post and which they both owned, Katharine Graham, at age 46 and a mother of three, with no work experience to speak of, found herself overseeing the Post through its most tumultuous and difficult years (think Watergate and the Pentagon papers). Eventually, she became one of the best CEOs of the 20th century, period. She pulled through and endured with a strong sense of purpose, fortitude, and strength that we can all learn from. In similar regard, read Eleanor Roosevelt’s two-volume biography to see how she managed to turn what was at the time a meaningless position in the White House into a powerful platform for change and influence."
"Books to read","This Boy's Life","This Boy’s Life by Tobias Wolff and Totto-Chan: The Little Girl at the Window by Tetsuko Kuroyanagi. If you wanted to read a book to become a successful, well-adjusted person, you probably could not do worse than Catcher in the Rye. Tobias Wolff’s memoir is a far better choice for the young man struggling with who he is and who he wants to be. I also suggest pairing it with the female counterpart: Totto-Chan. The latter is the memoir and biography of one of the most famous and successful women in Japan (akin to Oprah). It’s an inspiring little story of someone who didn’t fit in, who always saw the world differently (sound familiar?). But instead of making her hard, it made her empathetic and caring and kind — to say nothing of creative and unique. (The former is actually fiction but based on a true story. The latter is a true story but reads essentially like fiction)."
"Books to read","The Lives of the most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects","The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects by Giorgio Vasari. Basically a friend and peer of Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Raphael, Titian, and all the other great minds of the Renaissance, Giorgio Vasari sat down in 1550 and wrote biographical sketches of the people he knew or had influenced him. Unless you have a degree in Art History it’s unlikely that anyone pushed this book at you and that’s a shame. These great men were not just artists, they were masters of the political and social worlds they lived in. There are so many great lessons about craft and psychology within this book. The best part? It was written by someone who actually knew what he was talking about, not some art snob or critic; he was an actual artist and architect of equal stature to the people he was documenting."
"Books to read","Plutarch 's Lives 1 und 2","Plutarch’s Lives (I & II) by Plutarch. There are few books more influential and ubiquitous in Western culture than Plutarch’s histories. Aside from being the basis of much of Shakespeare, he was one of Montaigne’s favorite writers. His biographies and sketches of Pericles, Demosthenes, Themistocles, Cicero, Alexander the Great, Caesar, and Fabius are all excellent — and full of powerful anecdotes. These are moral biographies, intended to teach lessons about power, greed, honor, virtue, fate, duty, and all the important things they forget to mention in school."
"Books to read","Cyropaedia","Cyropaedia by Xenophon (a more accessible translation can be found in Xenophon’s Cyrus The Great: The Arts of Leadership and War). Xenophon, like Plato, was a student of Socrates. For whatever reason, his work is not nearly as famous, even though it is far more applicable. This book is the best biography written of Cyrus the Great, one of history’s greatest leaders and conquerors who is considered the “father of human rights.” There are so many great lessons in here and I wish more people would read it. Machiavelli learned them, as this book inspired The Prince."
"Books to read","The Fish that ate the Whale: The Life and Times of Americ's Banaa King","The Fish That Ate the Whale: The Life and Times of America’s Banana King by Rich Cohen. This book tells the incredible story of Sam Zemurray, the penniless Russian immigrant who, through pure hustle and drive, became the CEO of United Fruit, the biggest fruit company in the world. The greatness of Zemurray, as author Rich Cohen puts it, “lies in the fact that he never lost faith in his ability to salvage a situation.” For Zemurray, there was always a countermove, always a way through an obstacle, no matter how dire the situation."

"Books to read","Silence","ShuSaku Endo"
"Books to read","Big Data - a revolution that will trasform how we live, work, and think","Viktor Mayer-Schoenberger & Kennetgh Cukier\n\nA work examining the impact of the technology that now lets us to examine and sift through huge data sets (N=all) in some cases.   It underscores the value of accepting correlational results without attempting to understand causality.   It alerts us to the risks of deep mining of data and possible controls that might be necessary in the future.\n\nrating: B\n\nThe book was a page-turner in some chapters and deadly in others.   Sometimes it seemed as if the authors were padding the length by giving more examples than necessary and by repeating themselves often.   The authors seemed objective about their topic, neither exalting Big Data as the Next Big Thing nor denigrating it as a threat.\n\n"
"Books to read","Better Off","Eric Brende\n\nThe recounting of an experiment in which a MIT student spends 18 months in an Old Order Amish community in an attempt to determine the beneficial effects of avoiding modern technology.\n\nB\n\nThe author does a credible job at touting the benefits of non-technological living.   He spends a bit too much time in descriptions of his neighbors and too little time on the community as a whole.  His hypotheses don't account for what shoujld be done with the physically and mentally less able and the elderly.  These people can't enter in to the physical part of farming that builds community.   The work has the flavor of being trasnscribed from a diary and not re-woven into a story.\nThe irony of reading this anti-technology work on my iPad was not lost on me."
"Books to read","Traveling Mercies - Some Thoughts on Faith","Annie LaMott\n\nAn autobiographical recounting of the author's life and the process that led to her embrace of the christian faith.\n\nB\n\nMore a collection of short stories (one vignette per chapter) than a coherent narrative.   Instead of telling a tale the author ""dishes"" with you.   That technique works surprisingly well.  The author is not your stereotypical Christian and that makes her so much more approachable and believable.  \n"
"Books to read","The Barbarous Years","full title:  The Barbarous Years;  The Peopling of British North America:  The Conflict of Civilizations, 1600 - 1675\n\nBernard Bailyn\n\nA 500+ page historical (rather academic) work about the English, Dutch, and Swedish colonization of North America. \n\nB\n\nthis is one of those perspective-changing books that really gives a good idea about what life was like for the first colonists.   It also clarifies the real motivations for colonization.  Lastly it gives a better idea of what native american relationships really were.    Well written but would have benefitted by some editing and by leaving out redundant examples.   Contrasts nicely the Puritan Massachusetts settlement versus the purely economic Virginia colony.  The book sticks faithfully to its 1600 - 1675 time frame."
"Books to read","The Art of Tony Auth","Tony Auth\n\nAn anthology of his cartoons over the last 30 years.\n\nB\n\nTony Auth was an excellent political cartoonist who worked primarily for the Philadelphia Inquirer.   His stuff is amusing and topical and worth a read.   Although the book is over 200 pages long it can be read in about two hours."
"Books to read","The Political Collapse of Europe","Hajo Holborn\n\nA political interpretation of European history from roughly 1750 through 1950 (when the book was published).   This book is NOT primarily a telling of events, but is an interpretation of them.   Focus is on the so-called balance-of-power of the major European nations and how that balance was trashed during WW I and after.\n\nB\n\nAn interesting read.   Allows one to note with amusement what the author could not know, ie. the emergence of the European Union.   The author presupposes the reader has a working knowledge of European history which causes a lot of trips to the encyclopedia to understand what's being said.   The book could use a few maps;  There are no illustrations.   "
"Books to read","The Presidents Club - Inside the world's most exclusive fraternity","Nancy Gibb & Michael Duffy\n\nAn examination of the relationships of ex-presidents from Hoover to Bush\n\nRating: B\n\n"
"Books to read","The Half-Life of Facts","Samuel Arbesman\n\nAn exploration of the assertion that facts change over time.  Also explored was the way that facts disseminate over distance time and networks.\n\nC-\n\nI didn't actually finish the book. It was disorganized in  presentation.  There were many anecdotes but None seemed  to connect with the next. The author may have had a lot to say but he was not very good at \nsaying it\n\n"
"Books to read","Ape and Essence","Aldous Huxley\n\nA novel (really presented in screenplay format) about life on Earth following World War 3 - a nuclear war.   A boat from largely unaffected New Zealand explores the California coast and discovers a society that worships evil.   Sort of.\n\nrating: B+\n\nGiven that the work was published in 1948, Huxely seems almost prescient about what humans have done / will do to the earth and to each other.  IMHO too much time is dedicated to what has happened regarding sexual relations.   But then again everybody has to pay the mortgage.   The screenplay format suggests that perhaps Huxley first intended the work to be just that."
"Books to read","Coming Apart - the state of white america 1960 - 2010","Charles Murray\n\nA sociological look at new emerging classes in the US and the causes / effects of geographical separation of those classes.\n\nRating: B\n\nA bit scholarly for the popular market, the author's points are backed up by statistics and graphs and endless footnotes.  The books conclusion about the nation's direction is distrurbing."
"Books to read","Currency Wars -  The making of the next global crisis","James Rickards\n\nA history of the last two US ""currency wars"" (those times when Western countries tried to ""beggar thy neighbor"" by manipulating the value of their currencies) plus an analysis of the current situation following the 2008 panic.   It's concluded by exploring scenarios for the next currency war and sketches a few possible solutions for saving the show.\n\nB+\n\nFiscal and monetary policy is a dry topic so it takes a bit of work to get through this.   The author does not seem to have a particular agenda to sell, making the reading that more pleasant.  The only time he over-reaches imho is when he tries to apply complexity theory to finance.  The prose is well-written and is juxtaposed with graphics resulting in an accessible work."
"Books to read","Turing's Cathedral","George Dyson\n\nAn exposition of the development of digital computing from about 1930 - 1960 with stories about the prominent men and women in the field.   Also spotlighted development of Princeton Institute for Advanced Study.  \n\nrating C+\n\nA lot of information but DISORGANIZED - did not tell a story but dumped information on the page without a perceptible goal between chapters.   Also badly needed editing - much information (about people mostly) was included that had no bearing on the digital developments.  No character development.   Included mention of very minor contributors who could have been omitted.   By the 337th page I was praying for the book to end.  "
"Books to read","A Fine and Private Place","Ellery Queen\n\nA classic whodunit in classic Queen style.  A millionaire obsessed with the number 9 is murdered.   Ellery solves\n\nB-\n\nAdequate literary kleenex whodunit.   Unfortunately I figured it out about halfway through the story.   It seemed unbelieveable that Ellery took so long.  200 pages but can be read in a couple of hours."
"Books to read","Complete Collected Poems of Maya Angelou","Maya Angelou\n\nJust what the title says! A collection of poems.\n\nB\n\nAngelou is an excellent poet, though not in the same league with Frost or Elliot. \nFavorite poems:\n\nOn the pulse of morning\nAlone\nPhenomenal Woman\nMen\nStill I Rise\nOn Aging\nCaged Bird\nSavior\nOur Grandmothers\n"
"Books to read","In One Person","John Irving\n\nA novel about the life odessy of a bisexual lad born in small town america. \n\nrating:  C\n\nStock Irving -  wrestling, zaniness,  and sexual edginess.   Argues that we should be comfortable and accepting of differing sexual preferences -- no big controversy here.   Devotes a bit too much focus on sex at the expense of character development.   The large part of the book devoted to transsexuals detracts from the opportunity to really explore the life of the bisexual hero."
"Books to read","Gun Guys - A Road Trip","Dan Baum\n\nThe author, a middle age New Jersey Jewish liberal democrat NRA-card-carrying gun guy goes on a road trip to discover the ethos of the national gun demographic, psychologically and politically.\n\nrating: B\n\nThe author does a creditable job in selecting 7 or 8 people he met and devoting a chapter to each.   Each person brings out a different facet of the gun guy persona.   The people's stories tell more than just their words possibly could.  The author injects humor where appropriate which really helps talk about a serious subject flow better.  I enjoyed the book because it gave me a glimpse into a world I never thought existed.  Ultimately I think the author comes to the correct conclusion about what makes a gun guy tick."
"Books to read","Who Stole the American Dream?","Hedrick Smith\n\nAn analysis of what (in the author's opinion) has caused the malaise in the US middle class, economically, politically, and soca.  430 pages + 30 pages footnotes\n\nB+\n\nA surprisingly solid work.   I expected an ""ain't it awful"" liberal democratic rant but instead got a thoughtful thesis.  the work touches on the change in american industry toward the ""profit at all costs"" mentality which shorts the middle class.  The erosion of the political middle is excoriated.  the perils and fruits of plutocracy are exposed especially re the housing collapse.\n\nthe author was a New York Times reporter which may have contributed to the objectivity of the work.  There is some democrat bias but the republican party is not denegrated although the Tea Party is.\n\nMy chief criticism is that the author does not explore the effect of globalization and widening efficient markets."
"Books to read","Tap Dancing to Work","Warren Buffett / Carol Loomis\n\nA collection of articles about Warren Buffet, with perhaps 10 or so actually by Buffett.  The editing was done by Carol Loomis a personal friend and editor of his annual shareholder letter.  The subject is business, not Buffet's personal life.\n\nB\n\nit was a good profile of WB's business philosophy and world view.  It does not deal with WB's personal life much and is the poorer for it.   The hazard of collecting a number of articles is that each article (rightly) takes a paragraph or so to acquaint the reader with WB's successful history with Berkshire Hathaway.   Wtih 150 articles, you hear the same story 150 times.   I don't know how I'd fix this, but it becomes tedious."
"Books to read","Insane City","Dave Barry\n\nA novel spanning a weekend's time in which the hero goes to Miami to have a bachelor party and to wed.   The plot is too complex to summarize !\n\nrating: B+\n\nAbsolutely classic Barry with a circus of characters cruising on the edge of the plausible.   Reads a bit like a screenplay.   Very, verry funny !\n"
"Books to read","50 Things Liverals Love to Hate","Mike Gallagher\nA 50-item top ten list of things the author believes liberals hate.  Each item has about 4 pages of explanatory text.\n\nrating: C-\n\nI expected a humorous work akin to a Dave Barry.   The first two or three ""chapters"" had some funny stuff,  but beyond that the author (who is a talk-radio host) just engages in liberal-bashing.   Ironically enough he never defines ""liberal"".   He engages in painting his own version of a liberal demon then demolishes what he's just created.  He is unburdened with fact, at least none is quoted.   The book just turns into one giant rant and becomes tedious quickly.   \n\n"
"Books to read","Lunatics","Dave Barry & Alan Zweibel\n\nFiction about 2 jewish NJ residents who have outlandish adventures due to improbable juxtaposition.\n\nC\n\nDisappointing for Barry fans.   This work tried to get too wild too fast and became attenuated beyond reader's willingness to suspend.   First half of book was OK, even funny.   The second half dragged terribly.  "
"Books to read","The Pacific, and other stories","Mark Helprin\n\nA collection of short stories.\n\nB+\n\nThe author has a superb command of prose and uses it to paint a series of character portraits, if not actual fully resolved plots.   I'll definitely be reading more of his stuff.  The stories varied in locale, characters, and comedic content.   The author can handle it all !"
"Books to read","The Great War  1914 - 1918","Cyril Falls\n\nA detailed account of the military side of WWI.   \n\nrating: not applicable\n\nI abandoned reading this since the level of detail proved excruciating.   The author described most every motion of troops and even described generals' reputation, personality, and physical appearance.   Many references were made to cities and geographical figures without benefit of maps.   I'll look for a less detailed book."
"Books to read","Paradise Lost / Paradise Regained","John Milton\n\nParadise Lost - A 250 page blank verse heroic poem describing the fall of Satan and the horde of rebellious angels and the fall of Adam and Eve following.\n\nParadise Regained - a follow-up to Paradise Lost focusing on the temptation of Christ in the wilderness.  Not quite the equal of Paradise Lost, but what could be?\n\nrating:\nParadise Lost:  A+   - some of the finest verse found in the English Language.  Difficult to read in spots when the author flexes his knowledge of Classical Greek mythology.\n\nParadise Regained: A.  Easier to read but Milton still occasionally wanders off into Classic references at too great length.\n\n"
"Books to read","The Idea Factory - Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation","Jon Gertner\n\nA history of Bell Labs and the labs greatest inventions.   \n\nRating: B\n\nCaptures the flavor of the labs from the inside.   Could be a bit shorter."

The family “went shopping at the Life Store,” as Stimson puts it in her memoir, “Mud Season,’’ and “picked rolling mountains, roadside streams, and wooded knolls.” cq[21] Settling in tiny Dorset, they bought a big old house in ne... \nhttp://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2013/11/01/stimson-review-much-season-calamity-after-woman-dream-moving-vermont-raising-children-chickens-another-sheep-running-ellen-country-store-pretty/O0LDJeloFo5QVtU4ZX6FZL/story.html"

"Books to read","What is the what by Dave Eggers","Three of my favorite books focus on characters who have come to the States under difficult circumstances: the Sudanese refugee of Dave Eggers’s “What Is the What”; Bosnian refugee Jozef Pronek in Aleksandar Hemon’s “Nowhere Man”; and the Dominican family in Junot Díaz’s “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.” Each author is able to capture the absurdities of American life as seen through the eyes of a newcomer, while maintaining the pathos of the immigrant story.\n\nAnd I know I’m over my limit of one fictional hero, but my new book focuses on a 9-year-old boy, and my favorite child protagonists are Sherman Alexie’s semi fictional alter ego in “The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian” and the 11-year-old pop-star protagonist from Teddy Wayne’s “The Love Song of Jonny Valentine.” They’re both exceptional kids whose natural gifts allow them to leave home in pursuit of a dream. And both books thoughtfully show how the most sought-after positions — fame, money, acceptance, a fancy education — can sometimes be the least desirable.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/books/review/jesse-eisenberg-by-the-book.html?smid=tw-nytbooks&smtyp=cur&_r=5"

"Books to read","Asshole","Asshole - My favorite business book of all time. For anyone who will never embody the seven habits of effective people, or want to, Martin Kihn's fake self-help book about his journey from nice guy to asshole is both fun and informative. Asshole is full of chapter titles and concepts everyone can relate to, like ""Think Win/Lose"" and ""Be the Alpha Dog"". On a more serious note, since I typically lean toward being too nice, it was helpful for me to think about what aggressive professional qualities are advantageous in a professional environment."
"Books to read","Business adventures","Business Adventures - Affectionately known as the ""Bible for Billionaires"", Warren Buffet and Bill Gates' favorite business book is a collection of 12 New Yorker articles about business in America in the last century. Reading this book did not bring me any closer to either of these men's net worth, but I did learn about how a mine discovery in Canada led to the creation of modern insider trading law. It's also interesting to see how older companies such as Ford, Xerox and GE have changed since the 1950s as well as what characteristics from 70 years ago still define these organizations."
"Books to read","Simply managing","Simply Managing - This book should be required reading for MBAs. In less than 200 pages, it highlights all the key challenges of leading teams and organizations. Anyone with even the slightest management experience will relate to the concepts and anecdotes. As I read Simply Managing, I took solace in the fact that the issues I faced managing people were standard among accomplished managers in a variety of different industries."

The critic Terry Tea-chout, for in­stance, prefers Parker, judg­ing West­lake writ-ing as Stark “the clean­est of all noir nov­el­ists, a style­less styl-ist who gets to the point with stu­pen­dous econ­omy, hus­tling you down the path of plot so briskly that you have to read his books a sec­ond time to ap-pre­ci­ate the el­e­gance and sober wit with which they are writ­ten.”\n\n\nBut an equally learned West-lakean, the po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Steven Lenzner, begs to dif­fer. John Archibald Dort­munder—“mas­ter thief and Amer­i­can hero, a man whose bad luck is topped only (and barely) by his re­source­ful­ness and de­ter-mi­na­tion”—is the high­est ex-pres­sion of West­lake’s art, and the Dort­munder nov­els “form per­haps the only se­ries of its sort in which the later books are every bit as fresh as the early ones.”\n"

"Books to read","Dara Horn’s ‘Guide for the Perplexed’ - NYTimes.com","http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/books/review/dara-horns-guide-for-the-perplexed.html?_r=0\n\nAll That We Hold Dear\nDara Horn’s ‘Guide for the Perplexed’\n\nBy JAMI ATTENBERG\nPublished: September 27, 2013\nFACEBOOK\nTWITTER\nGOOGLE+\nSAVE\nEMAIL\nSHARE\nPRINT\nREPRINTS\n\nIn a recent New Yorker article about his time as a Google Glass Explorer, Gary Shteyngart discussed the challenge of setting a novel in the current moment, given the speed of social upheaval and technological advances. “To write a book set in the present, circa 2013,” he declared, “is to write about the distant past.” Dara Horn’s ambitious fourth novel, “A Guide for the Perplexed,” bears this exact burden: it is set partly in contemporary Egypt, post-­revolution, and much of its plot involves a technology not unlike Google Glass itself.\nEnlarge This Image\n\nJoon Mo Kang\nA GUIDE FOR THE PERPLEXED\nBy Dara Horn\n342 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $25.95.\nIt is a testament to the vitality of Horn’s writing that the book never gets mired in questions of what has already been invented and what has not. The Genizah technology it describes relies on various digital devices to track and catalog everything about a person’s life. Whether the technology is truly innovative is mostly irrelevant; the interesting point concerns how we handle the glut of information permeating our lives. Don’t we wish, sometimes, we could just throw it all away?\n\nAnd yes, because the Egyptian revolution has already happened in the book and the more recent upheavals have not, I was concerned the gap in reality might prove distracting. But the novel (like every novel) finally exists in its own universe, and Horn is hellbent on telling her intense, multilayered story.\n\n“A Guide for the Perplexed” has three overlapping narratives. The first is a retelling of the biblical story of Joseph and his brothers, as seen through the lives of the present-day sisters Josie and Judith Ashkenazi. Josie is the brilliant, beautiful, cocky inventor of the Genizah; Judith is her inferior in every way. (She was fired from four jobs in a year before going to work, grudgingly, as a publicist for her sister.) But Judith is clever and manipulative enough to persuade Josie to visit Egypt for three weeks as a consultant to the Library of Alexandria, just to get Josie out of her hair. When Josie is kidnapped and tortured in Cairo’s City of the Dead, Judith is left to contend with her guilt, as well as the lives of Josie’s husband and young daughter at home. More betrayal follows.\n\nThe true source of the sisters’ rivalry stems from their childhood, as Josie, the younger and their parents’ favorite, excels everywhere Judith does not. One of the book’s finer scenes depicts a nightmarish episode at a summer camp (always a rich source of terror) that seals their conflict: Josie, an asthmatic, is stranded by Judith and her cronies in a pit, where she suffers a hallucinatory attack in which she envisions memories from her life tucked inside a series of cabinet drawers. “It would occur to her, years later, that there was a pit like this buried inside each person — fascinating, painful and in the end so infinite that it was rendered useless. Why, she wondered? Who cared, in the end? What was the point of it, if you couldn’t use it to climb out?”\n\nTwo decades later, that moment in the pit is the inspiration for Josie’s Genizah program. Horn builds on the idea of the cabinet of memories throughout the book, questioning which we want to remember and which we would rather forget, as well as the relevance of our memories to our present lives and how they can hold us back.\n\nThe Genizah also leads to the book’s two other narrative threads, both inspired by real-life people: the 12th-century Jewish philosopher and physician Moses Maimonides, whose “Guide for the Perplexed” explores the relationship between faith and reason, and the 19th-century Cambridge professor Solomon Schechter, who (before he became a leader in the American Jewish community) gained academic fame for his 1896 discovery in Cairo of the world’s best-known genizah: a synagogue’s storage room for documents that, for religious reasons, can’t be thrown away.\n\nHorn fictionalizes Schechter’s discovery and excavation of these hundreds of thousands of documents, which included draft copies of the “Guide for the Perplexed” along with many other papers that turned out not to be valuable in the slightest — more memories that could have been discarded. Maimonides’ story line, meanwhile, follows the philosopher in Cairo in 1171 as he attempts to find an asthma cure for a pushy vizier. He also engages in philosophical discussions with his brother about the value of memory and the possibility (or not) of truly controlling it: “We choose what is worthy of our memory. We should probably be grateful that we can’t remember everything as God does, because if we did, we would find it impossible to forgive anyone.”\n\nHorn has taught Jewish literature and history, and her writing comes from a place of deep knowledge and research — but it sometimes leans a bit too heavily on its learning. In one 13-page scene, Schechter and a Cairo rabbi banter in religious verses and aphorisms, real and fake, to negotiate Schechter’s admission into the genizah, and the book begins to drag. Likewise, the conversations between Maimonides and his brother can be dry and didactic. This is a novel of ideas and information — perhaps too many ideas, perhaps too much information — and I could not escape the feeling I was being actively taught rather than just engaging with the storytelling. While these men pontificated, I often felt as if I were sitting in a lecture hall, staring out a window, daydreaming of Josie, kidnapped in Cairo, fighting for her life. I wanted to return to the real action, the present tense, rather than spend time with a wheezing man digging through endless piles of paperwork in a dusty room, or an ancient philosopher contemplating the universe.\n\nHorn is rigorously, impressively devoted to theme, and all of her novel’s threads are in service of it. No detail is out of place. (There is a copy of the original “Guide for the Perplexed” in the room where Josie is held hostage, and Josie soon wages her own philosophical arguments with Maimonides.) Still, sometimes the best lessons come when things are understated. I admired Horn’s intensity and integrity, much as I admired the same qualities in her characters. Yet I longed only not to be taught for a moment, to process the information in my own way. I wanted to be trusted to learn on my own.\n\nJami Attenberg’s most recent novel is “The Middlesteins.”\nA version of this review appears in print on September 29, 2013, on page BR22 of the Sunday Book Review with the headline: All That We Hold Dear.\nSAVE\nEMAIL\nSHARE\nGet Free E-mail Alerts on These Topics\n\nHorn, Dara	Books and Literature\nAds by Google	what's this?\nBrain Training Games\nTrain memory and attention\nwith scientific brain games.\nwww.lumosity.com\nLog In With Facebook\nLog in to see what your friends are sharing on nytimes.com.

"Books to read","Book Review: 'Maimonides' by Moshe Halbertal - WSJ.com","http://online.wsj.com/news/article_email/SB10001424052702304325004579298364238158816-lMyQjAxMTA0MDEwMTExNDEyWj\n'From Moses to Moses, there has been none like Moses"" runs the epitaph on the tomb of Moses Maimonides, comparing the medieval Jewish philosopher with his Biblical namesake—in the philosopher's favor. It would be hard to exaggerate the importance of this intellectual giant to Jewish civilization and, through his influence on Muslim and Christian thinkers, to Western civilization as a whole. In his rigorous and insightful study ""Maimonides: Life and Thought,"" Moshe Halbertal reintroduces readers to this rabbi-scientist, who insisted that faith should be an enterprise based on reason. What readers will gain from this remarkably modern thinker of the medieval age depends on their own reason—and their own faith.\n\nMaimonides\nBy Moshe Halbertal \nPrinceton, 385 pages, $35\n\nEnlarge Image\n\nA page from a 15th-century manuscript of Maimonides' 'Mishneh Torah.' The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, Israel / Extended loan from Michael and Judy Steinhardt, New York / The Bridgeman Art Library\n\nMuch of what is known about Maimonides' life comes from an extraordinary source: the Cairo Genizah, a thousand-year-old repository of nearly 200,000 medieval manuscripts discovered in 1897 on the grounds of a Cairo synagogue. Motivated by religious concerns about discarding Hebrew texts, Cairo's medieval Jewish community saved nearly all written documents, even children's schoolwork and sales receipts, providing a detailed picture of its civilization. Mr. Halbertal, a philosopher who wrote the Israeli Defense Forces' ethics manual, draws on Maimonides' works and correspondence, much of which was found in the Genizah, to situate his subject in the intellectual battles of his time.\n\nThe Genizah's documents present a 12th-century Egypt that feels uncannily familiar: the technology capital of the world, the crossroads of a global economy. Its philosophers, especially Maimonides, asked a question that we in our information age still ask: Are our lives determined by forces beyond our control, or do we have the free will to shape our own destiny?\n\nMaimonides was a physician, rabbi, politician and philosopher, and his life spanned concepts and continents. Born in Córdoba in 1138, he fled with his family to Morocco as a youth when a new, tyrannical Muslim regime took power and demanded that Spanish Jews convert or die. At 17 he published his ""Treatise on Logic,"" an introduction to Aristotelian logical principles; in his early 20s, while migrating through North Africa and then the Crusader-occupied Holy Land in flight from hostile regimes, he became a physician and began publishing on Jewish law.\n\nHe arrived and settled in Egypt and in 1171, he was appointed head of Cairo's large Jewish community, acting as Cairene Jewry's liaison to the Muslim ruling class. He later served as physician to a royal vizier and then to the sultan, Saladin, publishing medical treatises along the way, including works on treating chronic illnesses. Maimonides, though, mourned the intellectually rich Spanish Jewish community that had formed him, and he mourned his brother, a merchant who drowned on a trip to India. Mr. Halbertal views his two greatest works—""Mishneh Torah,"" his profound distillation of Jewish law, and ""Guide of the Perplexed,"" his astonishing reconciliation of faith and reason—as in part inspired by these losses.\n\nScholars often divide Maimonides' intellectual work in two: first, his efforts at codifying Jewish law, which previously existed mainly in the vast and often unresolved legal discussions in the 63 tractates of the Talmud; second, his philosophical writing that reconciles the science of his time with his Jewish (and by extension, all monotheistic) faith. Mr. Halbertal's achievement here is that he presents these two projects as a single one: a bold attempt by Maimonides to make sense of faith for an educated audience in an advanced civilization.\n\nPrior to Maimonides, Judaism had little by way of dogma. Jews were expected to believe in one God and to follow the Torah's commandments, but no list of beliefs defined Judaism. But Maimonides' quest to delineate Jewish belief, as Mr. Halbertal explains, wasn't some philosophical exercise but a historical necessity. Ancient Pagan regimes had presented Jews with stark physical choices—martyrdom, flight or practicing Judaism secretly. As for Christianity, Jews saw its God-incarnate as violating the Torah's prohibition on idolatry. But Islam was unambiguously monotheistic. Was it perhaps compatible with Judaism? And if so, why shouldn't a Jew convert? In answering this question for the Jews of Yemen, who posed it to him when faced with Islamic persecution—Maimonides' authority was respected by communities from France to Africa and beyond—the rabbi-philosopher presented not only a practical answer but a conceptual one. If one accepts the Torah as a public divine revelation, he posited, then any subsequent ""revised"" revelation, particularly one received in private, wouldn't merely suggest an imperfect Torah; it would suggest an imperfect God. Jews could not convert to Islam.\n\nIt is this concept—that God's perfection itself prevents divine interventions and ""miracles"" ousting the natural order—that vaults Maimonides' thought out of the world of mere piety and into the realm of philosophy. Followed to its logical conclusions, the idea of a perfect God demands a belief in a God who reveals himself not through violations of nature, but through nature itself. This sanctification of nature turns Judaism into a rigorously rational faith. Consider, for instance, Maimonides' idea of divine providence. God's protection, he insisted, doesn't come from divine intervention in human affairs, but rather through the divine gift of human intellect, which affords talented humans the capacity to solve human problems. As a physician, Maimonides couldn't believe that physical suffering was an act of divine will—because if that were true, then how could he cure a disease?\n\nMaimonides' faith was more modern than medieval. Yet it differs profoundly from today's casual agnosticism, because it was motivated by a philosophical humility rare in our time. In the discussion of idolatry in the Mishneh Torah, for example, Maimonides identified superstitions as not merely foolish, but as ""means employed by ancient idolaters to deceive the peoples of various countries and induce them to become their followers."" Idolatry, here, is less the belief in a false God than the false belief in human control over the world, whether through charlatan leaders or through the worshiper's own actions (if I do a rain dance, it will rain). In debunking this belief, Mr. Halbertal writes, Maimonides ""went so far as to make rationality into a religious obligation."" To be rational is to acknowledge human limitation. It means standing in awe of what we can't grasp.\n\n""The Guide of the Perplexed"" is Maimonides' greatest work. Written as letters to a Jewish student confused by Greek philosophy and its apparent conflict with the Torah, the ""Guide"" presents a system of Jewish belief that accommodates a scientific worldview—but in a highly enigmatic style that invites multiple interpretations. Wisely, Mr. Halbertal doesn't choose a single angle from which to view the text, but rather analyzes it from multiple perspectives, since, as he puts it, ""any attempt to propose a single consistent reading of the treatise strikes me as doomed to failure."" Instead, Mr. Halbertal suggests a ""skeptical"" reading, which veers toward agnosticism; a ""mystical"" reading, which assumes a hidden spirituality; a ""conservative reading,"" which keeps the work in line with the Torah; among others. (For those following at home, the most accurate English translation of the ""Guide"" is the edition by Shlomo Pines.)\n\nThe text is also a radical critique of religious language that would be at home in a literary-theory course. In rationalizing the Torah's descriptions of God's intervention in human affairs, Maimonides argues that any language describing God as having a body, or even emotions, must be understood metaphorically, as a feeble attempt to describe a presence beyond description. In doing so, Mr. Halbertal claims, Maimonides suggested that language itself is a kind of deception, an idolatry that props up the illusion of human power. As Mr. Halbertal puts it, ""Recognizing the limits on language is tantamount to recognizing the limits of our cognition of the world."" Whether this means that God can't be known at all, or that God simply can't be known through language, is one of the many questions that Maimonides left unanswered. This ambiguity and others like it give the ""Guide"" its enduring power, turning it into a fascinating test of the readers' own beliefs.\n\nMr. Halbertal's book isn't for the uninitiated. Despite its English subtitle, this is no biography. The author isn't a historian, and while the book's short biographical section provides the rudiments of Maimonides' life and a convincing sense of his personality, it takes primary sources at face value and is less reliable as a result. This is a philosophy book that doesn't try to seduce the non-analytic reader. Mr. Halbertal also assumes—appropriately for his original Hebrew-language audience—a knowledge of Jewish legal concepts that is basic to those with a Jewish education but alien to those without one. Readers unfamiliar with terms like halakhah (literally ""the walk,"" denoting Jewish law) or geonim (literally ""geniuses,"" denoting early medieval Babylonian rabbinic authorities) will be swimming upstream. Those merely curious about Maimonides may do better with Joel L. Kraemer's beautifully written 2008 biography, which provides a more accessible, if less nuanced, summary of his ideas along with ample historical and cultural background.\n\nBut those prepared to plunge into the depths will be rewarded with a mind-enlarging perspective that is absent from today's American culture, where theological arguments are typically reduced to a choice between arrogant atheism or mind-numbing faith. While Maimonides' ideas won't convince those wedded to either of the above, it is refreshing for today's perplexed to listen in on serious thinkers—both Maimonides and Moshe Halbertal—who refuse to check their brains or their faith at the door. As Mr. Halbertal says, the perplexed of every age can learn one thing from Maimonides: No matter what their dilemma may be, ""they should never allow it to foreclose human thought and inner integrity.""\n\n—Ms. Horn's most recent novel is \n""A Guide for the Perplexed.""\n\nEmail\n \nPrint\n \nSave\n↓ More\n \n Comments\n \nOrder Reprints\n \nFacebook\n \nTwitter\n \nGoogle+\n \nLinkedIn\nWSJ In-Depth\n\nSyrian Kids Grow Up Fast\n\nThe Lobotomy Files: Forgotten Soldiers\n\nFor Delhi Cop, Tradition Overwhelms Badge\n\nGreece Struggles to Outlaw Fascists\n\nFall of King Coal Hits Hard in Kentucky\n\nInside the Breakup of the Pritzker Empire\n\nBig changes are coming to WSJ.com.

"Books to read","Mortality","Christopher Hitchens\n\nShort, journal-based exposition of the author's life following his cancer diagnosis and ending in his death.  \n\nB+\n\nHitchens was an excellent writer and speaker to begin with.   Add on the poignancy and intimacy of the subject matter and a superb book emerges.   The last chapter naturally is sketchy since the author did not live to refine the prose.  Hitchens shows a flair for nuanced brevity which is welcome in these days of endless exposition.\n\n"
"Books to read","Out of Order","Sandra Day O'Connor\n\nA collection of stories about the US Supreme Court.\n\nB-\n\nOK as far as it went, it felt like a desultory work consisting of things that the author could remember.   No central theme was evident.  The book did not discuss many court decisions, the real reason for the Court's existance.   Face it, the Court is not a very exciting place !"
"Books to read","Selected Poems","T.S. Eliot\n\nA selection of his most famous poetry including Prufrock, Hollow Men, and Wasteland.\n\nrating: A-\n\nHow do you argue with a nobel prize winner?   When reading Eliot it's helpful to have exposure to British english, french, german, and latin.   A working knowledge of greek and roman mythology helps too.  Sometimes the poems don't make literal sense but a mood is created nonetheless."
"Books to read","Quest","Daniel Yergin\n\nA history and explanation of energy (in all its many forms) issues.   \n\nrating B+\n\nExcellent reference if you want a comprehensive picture of energy issues.    The work was throrough but accessible to the layman.  The book was 717 pages but still hard to put down.   Much of the story was about oil, but every energy form was discussed.  Once I finished, I felt competent to comprehend the significance of news stories about energy.    The author has a bit of a gift for storytelling."
"Books to read","Dream More","Dolly Parton\n\nLife advice from Dolly, putting premium on aspiration, hard work, spirituality, and tolerance.\n\n\nC+\n\nVery moving book if you know about the life and music of Dolly Parton (rages to riches) but would not mean much if you didn't.   Contains unusually candid account of the value she puts on spirituality.   "
"Books to read","Bailout","Neil Barofsky\n\nA history of the author's 3-year stint as Special Inspector General of the Troubled Assets Relief Fund (TARP), the fund set up to save banks and auto industry companies from bankrupcy in 2008 - 2011.\n\nrating: B\n\nBook gives a fair picture of the author's battles with the USGOV establishment, especially Treasury.   A liberal bias is evident, insinuating that USGOV only really cares about large institutions, not about citizens.   This overlooks the reality of those years in which NOBODY knew exactly what to do, and that a collapse of the system would have been financial armegeddon. "

After all, boys might be good for a dance or a drink and certainly a little under-cover action of the scandalous variety, but expect much else and you're bound for heart ache.\n\nSo when her best friends and fellow boy catchers start dropping like flies junior year, Jillian is determined to keep boys in her bedroom and out of her heart. Until she meets Liam McAvoy, the kind of guy that sticks around to make waffles and who can't—or perhaps won't—take a hint.\n\nStudy abroad student Liam doesn't want to be another notch on Jillian's bedpost. Actually he has much more interesting ideas for Jillian and her bedposts, but his student visa's set expiration date means he can't promise her forever. That doesn't mean he's going to walk away from the challenge of discovering why Jillian is hell-bent at keeping people at a distance.\n\nBefore long, neither is sure who is catching who—or if they're playing for keeps. Jillian knows one thing though: falling in love will not only break the only rule of boy-catching, it could also break her heart."

"Books to read","Man's Search for Meaning - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","Man's Search for Meaning is a 1946 book by Viktor Frankl chronicling his experiences as an Auschwitz concentration camp inmate during World War II, and describing his psychotherapeutic method, which involved identifying a purpose in life to feel positively about, and then immersively imagining that outcome. According to Frankl, the way a prisoner imagined the future affected his longevity. The book intends to answer the question ""How was everyday life in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of the average prisoner?"" Part One constitutes Frankl's analysis of his experiences in the concentration camps, while Part Two introduces his ideas of meaning and his theory called logotherapy.\nAccording to a survey conducted by the Book-of-the-Month Club and the Library of Congress, Man's Search For Meaning belongs to a list of ""the ten most influential books in the United States.""[1] At the time of the author's death in 1997, the book had sold over 10 million copies and had been translated i... \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning"

"Books to read","8 знаний","8 самых полезных знаний \n\nПитер Друкер - гуру бизнеса, считал, что обладание истинной силой связано с отбором и осмыслением больших объемов информации, а затем - преобразованием их в действие.\n\nДействие - ключевой момент. Предлагаем вам самые действенные направления саморазвития.\n\n1. Освойте финансовую грамотность\nПрименяйте в жизни правила работы с деньгами. Узнайте, как создать свое дело и распоряжаться деньгами.\n\nВ первую очередь прочтите книги:\n- Роберт Кийосаки «Богатый папы, Бедный папа»;\n- Юрий Мороз «Бизнес. Пособие для гениев»;\n- Роберт Аллен «Множественные источники дохода».\n\n2. Научитесь мыслить\nСуществуют специальные техники мышления. Освойте их по книгам:\n- Эдварда де Боно;\n- и теории решения изобретательских задач (ТРИЗ).\n\n3. Узнайте как работает память человека\nПрочтите книгу Владимира Козаренко «Учебник мнемотехники». Если у вас есть дети, то они станут отличниками в школе, просто применяя техники запоминания.\n\n4. Научитесь быстро читать\nОдин месяц тренировок - и вы будете читать в 2 раза быстрее. Выполните все упражнения из книги Олега Андреева «Учитесь быстро читать».\n\n5. Освойте навык слепой печати\nЗанимайтесь 2 недели по 15 минут в день с программой Стамина. И вы сможете удивить своих друзей, печатая вслепую. А главное, сэкономите себе время в будущем на наборе текста .\n\n6. Управляйте своими снами\nНаучившись контролировать сны, вы откроете доступ к своим творческим способностям. Пройдите курс «Осознанное сновидение за 7 дней» или прочитайте книги по снам. Осознанные сны - захватывающие приключения, они как 3D фильмы с вашим личным участием.\n\n7. Изучите законы успеха\nУспешные люди знают то, чего не знают другие. Существуют секреты успеха, применяя которые, можно добиться желаемого. Самая полная коллекция работающих материалов об успехе собрана в сборнике «Магия успеха».\n\n8. Проработайте свои эмоции. Управляйте сексуальной энергией.\nСамый важный этап развития. Именно, нереализованные эмоции создают препятствие в саморазвитии.\nПрочтите книги:\n- Александр Лоуэн «Психология тела»;\n- Станислав Гроф «Холотропное сознание»;\n- книги Мантек Чиа."
"Books to read","Пять навыков хорошего маркетолога","тысяч запросов относительно новых свойств товаров. «Как это часто бывает в больших компаниях, разработчики товаров принимают решения, полагаясь на возможности рынка, или же на основании того, какой потребительский сегмент обладает большей покупательской способностью. Но от этого ваши клиенты или ваша фирма вряд ли выиграют», — считает директор по маркетингу компании SAP Джонатан Бечер. В результате он вместе со своей командой придумал совершенно новый подход к тому, как разработать хороший товар или улучшить уже существующий. Этот процесс основан на сотрудничестве с покупателями и краудсорсинге. Команда Бечера создала сайт под названием «Место для идей», где сообщество из более чем двух миллионов посетителей в месяц может голосовать и оценивать предлагаемые компанией изменения. Самые удачные, по мнению пользователей, идеи переходят к команде разработчиков и партнерам. Подобный механизм помог создать 10 тысяч заявок и привел к 600 улучшениям различных товарных характеристик. Вдобавок, открытость процесса положительно повлияла на контакт с покупателями и на их реакцию на готовый продукт. \nhttp://hbr-russia.ru/lichnaya-effektivnost/navyki/p13213/"

You can cut the corpus callosum and essentially have 2 minds that are both “you” living side by side in the same head. Daniel Kahneman, in Thinking Fast and Slow, also highly recommended, breaks it down into System 1 (the fast, intuitive, automatic, emotional brain) and System 2 (the rational, guiding, intentional brain). In Marvin Minsky’s Society of Mind, yes, highly recommended, he talks about how our brains could be considered to be an entire community of partial minds, with a throne (the self) that appoints leaders to run things, and that throne goes through power struggles, times of revolution and times of dictatorship and times of peaceful solidarity.\n\n(I personally have a weird theory that our brains are running a constant simulation of the universe, which includes models for our self, other people, other forces, in order to tell a story about the past and predict the future"

Ward\n\nAvery’s emotions are fried, but she doesn’t have to think twice about her BFFs Marty and Mel. They mean everything to her. They’re the family she doesn’t have. In a crisis, they’re the people to have by her side, and God knows this is a crisis. Friends like that are worth their weight in gold.\n\nIf only things with Sean were so simple. Regret is something that is impossible to subdue. There are still things to be said, things to do. Life is too short to live in the past, but when Avery wakes up at the hospital she finds that her world has changed."
"Books to read","Damaged (Damaged #1, The Ferro Family/Peter) by H.M. Ward by H.M. Ward","Life sucks. And, as soon as Sidney picks up the pieces something always knocks her back onto her butt. It's never pretty, but this time is different. This time pretty isn't even the right word.\n\nPeter is the personification of perfection. It's like he fell off his angel perch in purgatory, because let's face it--any guy that hot has got to be naughty. He was probably sent here to ruin her life.\n\nPeter is beyond beautiful with his sexy blue eyes, dark hair, and toned body. Add in his charming wit and Peter is everything Sidney ever wanted in a man, but when things get hot and heavy Peter shows her the door. Sidney takes the walk of shame and leaves. It's the end of the worst blind date ever. Her life couldn't possibly reach higher levels of suckage, but it does.\n\nThe next morning everything comes crashing down. The insanely hot guy from last night, the one that saw her half naked, is teaching at the front of the class room."
"Books to read","The Arrangement (The Arrangement #9, The Ferro Family/Sean) by H.M. Ward","When Avery finds out that the cowboy who requested her services for the night is Marty, things take an unexpected turn. If Avery declines her friend, she'll be in trouble with Miss Black, but if she accepts--this could mean a new, normal relationship and saying farewell to Sean forever."
"Books to read","The Arrangement (The Arrangement #3, The Ferro Family/Sean) by H.M. Ward","Volume 3 in the bestselling Arrangement Serials\n\nSex isn't love, but it feels like it--that is until Sean bolts from the room. For a moment, everything seemed fine. Avery's life didn't feel so impossible. She got the guy and the money, but then everything shifts. The line between reality and fantasy gets hazy. It's impossible to know if her feelings are genuine or just an illusion.\n\nTo make matters worse something from Sean's past surfaces. Devastated, Avery realizes that Sean isn't the guy that she thought he was. Avery's heart can't take another loss and this time, it looks like she's going to lose everything."
"Books to read","Teaching Roman (Good Girls Don't #2) by Sophia Bleu","Jessica Stone has her life in perfect order until her perfectly boring boyfriend Brett puts things in perspective. So when she receives a call to action from her heartbroken best friend Cassie, she ditches her plans for Winter Break in gloomy Olympic Falls and sets off to Mexico for some fun in the sun.\n\nDetermined to use her oceanview to prep for her MCATS, she doesn't plan to run into anyone from Olympic State, least of all the cute communications prof she's been crushing on for a year. When he unexpectedly saves the day, the two are thrown together in a distinctly extracurricular activity.\n\nRoman Markson doesn’t expect to run into anyone he knows from Olympic Falls while visiting his family in Puerto Vallarta, especially not a former student. Although Jess Stone has a way of catching men’s attention, a relationship with her is strictly off-limits. However, the rules feel less strict in Mexico, so they agree to a plan: one week in paradise and nothing more.\n\nBut avoiding each other back on campus is harder than they anticipated, especially when they can’t stay away from one another. Neither is sure what they have to learn—and lose—before life teaches them a lesson they’ll never forget."
"Books to read","Backdraft (The Secret Life of Trystan Scott #2) by H.M. Ward","When Mari realizes that Trystan is the internet megastar, Day Jones, she can’t speak. Every time she listens to his song, it leaves her feeling so much. That song is bewitching. Everyone she knows heard it. As soon as it appeared on YouTube, it went viral, and then the guy who wrote it disappeared. Despite agents and record labels trying to lure Day5705 out, he remains anonymous. No one knows who Day Jones really is—except Mari.\n\nTo Trystan’s relief, Mari agrees to keep his secret. Part of him regrets uploading the song, but when he sings to Mari the song that once brought him solace, it fills him joy. In a life like his, joy is fleeting and Trystan plans on grabbing hold whenever a shot at happiness appears. To his surprise, Mari doesn’t realize the song is about her. When Trystan tries to push her to see, he jeopardizes losing her entirely.\n\nOne misplaced kiss topples the fragile relationship, leaving Trystan reeling, trying to assemble the pieces and convincing Mari that she’s not just another conquest, even though everything he did—everything he said—makes it seem like she is. It isn’t until Mari decides that being the good girl isn’t working that things steam up. Trystan knows she wants to hook up with someone, and he doesn’t know if he should stop her. Every attempt he makes to win her over goes bad and pushes her further away.\n\nAs the world gets one day closer to tracking down Day Jones, Trystan is one day closer to graduation and leaving this life forever. If Mari doesn’t realize he loves her by then, she never will."

"Books to read","Das deutsche Finanzsystem: Achillesferse der Wirtschaft? (siehe notes)","http://www.amazon.de/Das-deutsche-Finanzsystem-Achillesferse-Wirtschaft/dp/3791030841\n \n \nBanken / LBBW\nHandelsblatt, 11.04.11\nJaschinski erklärt die Finanzwelt\nSiegfried Jaschinski, einst Chef von Deutschlands drittgrößter Bank, erklärt in seinem Buch „Das deutsche Finanzsystem“, wie Börsen und Banken funktionieren. Und das ist größtenteils auch für Laien verständlich.\nDüsseldorfEinst war er der Chef von Deutschlands drittgrößter Bank. Doch 2009 geriet seine LBBW - die Landesbank Baden-Württemberg - in den Strudel der Finanzkrise, und Siegfried Jaschinski musste gehen. Der selbstbewusste Banker mit dem Spitznamen „Alexander der Große“ - über diesen Herrn hatte er einst promoviert - heuerte Anfang 2011 dann bei der kleinen Main-First Bank an.\nIn der Zwischenzeit hat er ein Buch über das deutsche Finanzsystem geschrieben. Es ist ein gutes Buch geworden. Aber wer spektakuläre Thesen oder Enthüllungen aus dem mitunter unübersichtlichen Gewebe aus Landesbanken und Politik erwartet, dürfte enttäuscht werden.\nJaschinski erklärt sehr präzise, faktenreich und über weite Strecken auch für Laien verständlich, wie Banken und Börsen in Deutschland funktionieren. Man spürt: Hier schreibt einer, der das Geschäft genau kennt, aber nicht vergessen hat, wie Leute denken und sprechen, die keine Banker sind. Jaschinski gibt auch einen knappen historischen Abriss der deutschen und internationalen Finanzkrisen seit dem Fall Herstatt in den 70er-Jahren über den taumelnden Hedge-Fonds LTCM 1998 bis zum jüngsten Beinahe-Zusammenbruch des Systems. Er erläutert die Struktur der Branche in Deutschland und vergleicht sie mit anderen Ländern auf dem europäischen Kontinent.\nAn einigen Stellen ist Jaschinski erfrischend deutlich. Zum Beispiel wenn er über den amerikanischen Versicherer AIG schreibt: „Ohne staatliche Unterstützung der AIG zwei Tage nach dem Lehman-Zusammenbruch wäre es zu einer Existenzkrise … einschließlich der Deutschen Bank gekommen.“\nEr stellt auch Entwicklungen pointiert heraus, die nicht jedem bewusst sein dürften. Etwa, dass vor der Zerschlagung der „Deutschland AG“ - der engen Verflechtung deutscher Banken und Industriekonzerne - durch die rot-grüne Bundesregierung die Hauptaktionäre börsennotierter Unternehmen im Schnitt mehr als 50 Prozent der Anteile hielten - gegenüber fünf bis zehn Prozent in anderen Ländern.\nSehr originelle Thesen vertritt Jaschinski indes nicht. Er befürchtet, dass der Abbau langfristiger Firmenkredite nach der Finanzkrise das Wachstum in Deutschland ausbremsen könnte: Denn so brauchen die Unternehmen mehr Eigenkapital, und das ist für Mittelständler oft schwer zu beschaffen.\nImmer wieder betont er, wie wichtig es sei, dass Banken eine eigene, möglichst stabile Kundenbasis haben. Außerdem fordert Jaschinski, in Deutschland einen starken und profitablen Bankensektor, ähnlich wie in den Nachbarländern zu schaffen, mit mindestens zwei großen Instituten neben der Deutschen Bank und der Commerzbank. Aber wie genau das gehen soll, verrät er nicht.\nSiegfried Jaschinski: Das deutsche Finanzsystem. Achillesferse der Wirtschaft? Schäffer Poeschl, Stuttgart 2011, 139 Seiten, 19,95 Euro\n "

En lupaa, että tosielämän ranskattaret söisivät juuri näin kuin Guiliano kertoo (minusta tuntuu, että Ranskassa ihmisiä painostetaan hoikkuuteen paljon enemmän kuin Guiliano haluaisi myöntää), mutta onko tuolla väliäkään? Totta tai ei, kirja tarjoaa hyviä oivalluksia ja kirjan periaatteet oikeasti toimivat, sekä sen vyötärölinjan että elämänilon kannalta.\n- Kaikki mitä rakastin"

In this groundbreaking book, she shows how we can leverage the power of games to fix what is wrong with the real world-from social problems like depression and obesity to global issues like poverty and climate change-and introduces us to cutting-edge games that are already changing the business, education, and nonprofit worlds. Written for gamers and non-gamers alike, Reality Is Broken shows that the future will belong to those who can understand, design, and play games.\n"

"Books to read","Switch: How to Change Things when Change is Hard by Chip Heath and Dan Heath","In 'Switch', authors Chip and Dan Heath delve deep inside the human psyche to explain why this should be so, but they also argue that once we understand how our minds function, there are practical steps we can take to overcome our inbuilt resistance to change. And the results can be extraordinary.\n\nhttp://books.google.bg/books?id=Q-J7SQAACAAJ"
"Books to read","Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman","Why is there more chance we'll believe something if it's in a bold type face?\nWhy are judges more likely to deny parole before lunch?\nWhy do we assume a good-looking person will be more competent?\nThe answer lies in the two ways we make choices: fast, intuitive thinking, and slow, rational thinking. This book reveals how our minds are tripped up by error and prejudice (even when we think we are being logical), and gives you practical techniques for slower, smarter thinking. It will enable to you make better decisions at work, at home, and in everything you do.\n'There may be no other person on the planet who better understands how and why we make the choices we make. This absolutely amazing book is a must read for anyone with a curious mind' Steven D. Levitt, co-author of Freakonomics  \n'A masterpiece . . . compulsively readable . . . one of the greatest and most engaging collections of insights into the human mind I have read' Financial Times\n'A landmark book.' Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of The Black Swan\n'Terrific . . . full of brilliant anecdote and wisdom'  Tim Adams, Observer, Books of the Year\n\nhttp://books.google.bg/books?id=AV9x8XakdV0C"
"Books to read","The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz","A lot of people talk about how great it is to start a business, but only Ben Horowitz is brutally honest about how hard it is to run one.\n\nIn The Hard Thing About Hard Things, Ben Horowitz, cofounder of Andreessen Horowitz and one of Silicon Valley's most respected and experienced entrepreneurs, draws on his own story of founding, running, selling, buying, managing, and investing in technology companies to offer essential advice and practical wisdom for navigating the toughest problems business schools don't cover. His blog has garnered a devoted following of millions of readers who have come to rely on him to help them run their businesses. A lifelong rap fan, Horowitz amplifies business lessons with lyrics from his favourite songs and tells it straight about everything from firing friends to poaching competitors, from cultivating and sustaining a CEO mentality to knowing the right time to cash in.\n\nhttp://books.google.bg/books?id=620pAgAAQBAJ"
"Books to read","Outliers: The Story of Success by Malcolm Gladwell","There is a story that is usually told about extremely successful people, a story that focuses on intelligence and ambition. Gladwell argues that the true story of success is very different, and that if we want to understand how some people thrive, we should spend more time looking around them-at such things as their family, their birthplace, or even their birth date. And in revealing that hidden logic, Gladwell presents a fascinating and provocative blueprint for making the most of human potential.\n\nIn The Tipping Point Gladwell changed the way we understand the world. In Blink he changed the way we think about thinking. In OUTLIERS he transforms the way we understand success.\n\nhttp://books.google.bg/books?id=0jbIBAAAQBAJ"
"Books to read","Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future by Peter Thiel","""Thiel starts from the bold premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we're too distracted by our new mobile devices to notice. Progress has stalled in every industry except computers, and globalisation is hardly the revolution people think it is. It's true that the world can get marginally richer by building new copies of old inventions, making horizontal progress from ""1 to n."" But true innovators have nothing to copy. The most valuable companies of the future will make vertical progress from ""0 to 1,"" creating entirely new industries and products that have never existed before. Zero to One is about how to build these companies. Tomorrow's champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today's marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique. In today's post-internet bubble world, conventional wisdom dictates that all the good ideas are taken, and the economy becomes a tournament in which everyone competes to reach the top. Zero to One shows how to quit the zero-sum tournament by finding an untapped market, creating a new product, and quickly scaling up a monopoly business that captures lasting value. Planning an escape from competition is essential for every business and every individual, not just for technology startups. The greatest secret of the modern era is that there are still unique frontiers to explore and new problems to solve. Zero to One shows how to pursue them using the most important, most difficult, and most underrated skill in every job or industry: thinking for yourself""—\n\nhttp://books.google.bg/books?id=Owc2nQEACAAJ"

Alinsky, and his last book, published in 1971 shortly before his death. His goal for the Rules for Radicals was to create a guide for future community organizers to use in uniting low-income communities, or “Have-Nots”, in order to empower them to gain social, political, and economic equality by challenging the current agencies that promoted their inequality. Within it, Alinsky compiled the lessons he had learned throughout his personal experiences of community organizing spanning from 1939-1971 and targeted these lessons at the current, new generation of radicals.\nDivided into ten chapters, each chapter of Rules for Radicals provides a lesson on how a community organizer can accomplish the goal of successfully uniting people into an active organization with the power to affect change on a variety of issues. Though targeted at community organization, these chapters also touch o... \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_for_Radicals"

"Books to read","Lud-in-the-Mist - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","Lud-in-the-Mist (1926) is the third of three novels by Hope Mirrlees. It continues the author's exploration of the themes of Life and Art, by a method already described in the preface of her first novel, Madeleine: One of Love's Jansenists (1919): ""to turn from time to time upon the action the fantastic limelight of eternity, with a sudden effect of unreality and the hint of a world within a world"".\nWhereas in Madeleine and The Counterplot Mirrlees took from historical figures, religions and literature the elements with which to build her stage, her use of a secondary-world setting in Lud-in-the-Mist links it to a tradition of high fantasy, and thence to its current locus of popularity. In 1970, an American reprint appeared without the author's permission, as part of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series. It was subsequently reprinted by Orion Books in 2000 as part of their Fantasy Masterworks series.

Brave, headstrong, and dreaming of being a cook, she fought to climb up from the lowest rung of the domestic-service ladder.

Sought after by New York aristocracy, and with an independence rare for a woman of the time, she seemed to have achieved the life she’d aimed for when she arrived in Castle Garden.

"Books to read","10 романов о феменизме","10 книг о феминизме \n \n1. Дорис Леслинг — ""Расщелина"" \n \nРоман известной английской писательницы, лауреата Нобелевской премии Дорис Лессинг рассказывает о древней женской общине, существовавшей в прибрежной полосе Эдема. Женщины этой общины не знали мужчин и в них не нуждались. Деторождение управлялось лунным циклом, рожали они исключительно девочек. И вот появление на свет странного ребенка - мальчика - угрожает разрушить гармонию их существования… \n \n2. Моник Виттиг — ""Лесбийское тело"" \n \n""Лесбийское тело"" - самый радикальный феминистский роман XX века. Моник Виттиг (1935-2003) выступала не просто против мужского угнетения и традиционной семьи, но и против концепции пола как таковой, ставила под сомнение существование ""мужчин"" и ""женщин"". В лесбийской ""Песни песней"" Моник Виттиг предлагает ""пересказывать собственное тело"", деконструируя патриархальный мужской язык ради создания нового языка лесбийского бунта против гетеросексуального общества. \n \n3. Маргарет Этвуд — ""Съедобная женщина"" \n \nВ цивилизованном мире воспитанных людей процветает ритуальный каннибализм. Проще всего быть амебой: они бессмертны, эластичны и бесформенны. Быть личностью - ужасно сложно. Мэриан патологически нормальна, и жизнь не обещает ей сюрпризов. На сценарий, не раз опробованный миллионами людей, так легко согласиться, однако выясняется, что нормальность жизни и поглощение всеми всех Мэриан невыносимы. Ей грозит раствориться в семейной жизни, а значит, ее будущий муж - тот же людоед. Нежный девичий организм отказывается переваривать такие нормы - в буквальном смысле. \nПеред вами первый роман лауреата Букеровской премии Маргарет Этвуд (р. 1939) ""Съедобная женщина"", предвосхитивший массовое феминистское движение. \n \n4. Ив Энцлер — ""Отличное тело"" \n \nИв Энцлер, писательница, драматург и общественный деятель с мировым именем, предъявляет человечеству манифест под названием ""Отличное тело"". В этой книге, как и в одноименном спектакле, Энцлер щедро одаривает своим вниманием женское тело в целом, призывая читателя и зрителя к принятию этого ""дива дивного, чуда чудного"" таким, какое оно есть. Пластичное, могучее, исполненное истинного жизнелюбия, всегда уникальное и единственное, женское тело в глазах Ив Энцлер - вечный праздник, который всегда с тобой, невзирая на кажущиеся избыточности или недостаточности! \n \n5. Вирджиния Вульф — ""Годы"" \n \nВирджиния Вулф (1882-1941) - английская писательница, великий прозаик минувшего столетия, критик и теоретик модернизма. \nДействие романа ""Годы"", одного из самых значительных произведений В. Вулф, разворачивается на протяжении пятидесяти лет - с 1880-го и до середины 30-х годов ХХ века. Ломаются викторианские традиции, появляются автомобили и самолеты, Европу охватывает Первая мировая война... Все это служит фоном семейной саги - истории семейства Парджитеров: полковник Эйбел Парджитер, его жена, любовница, семеро детей, их жены, мужья, многочисленные родственники... \n \n6. Генрик Ибсен — ""Кукольный дом"" \n \nГенрик Ибсен - знаменитый норвежский драматург, поэт и публицист, один из основателей европейской ""новой драмы"". Многие его пьесы, такие как ""Бранд"", ""ПерГюнт"", ""Кукольный дом"", ""Привидения"", ""Дикая утка"", вошли в число лучших произведений мировой драматургии.  \nНоваторство Ибсена в создании ""новой драмы"" наиболее ярко выразилось в самой известной его пьесе ""Кукольный дом"". В центре внимания ее - драма молодой женщины, матери, решившейся на крутой поворот в своей судьбе, когда она осознала, что ее семейное счастье - лишь иллюзия, основанная на лжи и эгоизме. Когда-то Нора пошла на преступление ради близкого человека в надежде, что ее поймут и простят, и обманулась. Нора уходит, понимая, что обрекает себя на одиночество, но она не в силах больше играть роль счастливой хозяйки ""кукольного дома"". \n \n7. Эльфрида Елинек — ""Любовницы"" \n \nСамая известная современная писательница Европы, скандально знаменитый нобелевский лауреат Эльфрида Елинек бросает миру в лицо свои произведения, но мир при этом не чувствует себя оскорбленным, ""это не про меня"" - говорит каждый...  \nПрепарируя ханжеское общество, где потребительские ценности перемешались с патриархальными традициями и где ""респектабельность"" напрямую зависит оттого, какими вещами ты обладаешь, Елинек рисует две противоположные судьбы. Бригитта и Паула - две девушки, одна из города, вторая из деревни, но для обеих любовь, семья и секс - лишь средства, чтобы пробиться в жизни, - в жизни, в которой каждая из них будет обладать высокой покупательской способностью.  \n \n8. Симона де Бовуар — ""Второй пол"" \n \nДва тома книги «Второй пол» французской писательницы Симоны де Бовуар (1908—1986) — «прирождённого философа», по словам её мужа Ж.-П. Сартра, — до сих пор считаются самым полным историко-философским исследованием всего комплекса проблем, связанных с женщиной. Что такое «женский удел», что стоит за понятием «природное назначение пола», чем и почему положение женщины в этом мире отличается от положения мужчины, способна ли в принципе женщина состояться как полноценная личность, и если - да, то в каких условиях, какие обстоятельства ограничивают свободу женщины и как их преодолеть. \n \n9. Бетти Фридан — ""Загадка Женственности"" \n \nСегодня ""Загадка женственности"" - это классика, знакомая каждой читающей женщине, это неотъемлемая часть истории женского освободительного движения, это часть мировой культуры. Книга стала первым в стране серьезным социологическим исследованием того социального явления, которое превалировало в послевоенной Америке и шло под лозунгами ""обратно к дому"" или ""назад к семье "". В ней бы дан точный и скрупулезный анализ причин этого. Со свойственной ей страстностью Бетти обвиняла всех: социологов и психологов, профессоров и политических деятелей, которые не переставали утверждать, что роль женщины - только семья и дети. Она же утверждала, что это архаично, реакционно и полностью лишает вторую половину рода человеческого проявить свои таланты и реализовать скрытые возможности, которые полностью вытесняются домом и семьей. Книга была полемична и в некотором смысле противоречива, но сразу стала бестселлером. \n \n10. Эрика Йонг — ""Как спасти свою жизнь"" \n \n""Как спасти свою жизнь"" - это продолжение истории писательницы Айседоры Уинг, героини книги ""Я не боюсь летать"", вызвавшей настоящий шок в Америке 1970-х годов и вошедшей в список самых сексуальных романов в истории человечества. Наконец-то Айседора достигла вершины славы, о ней говорят, ею восхищаются, ее ненавидят. Но, несмотря на всю эту звездную мишуру, она так и не преодолела по-настоящему страх полета, не обрела любви, которая единственная дает человеку крылья. И вот однажды, приглашенная в Голливуд для работы над экранизацией своего романа, Айседора Уинг неожиданно встречает того, кто способен дать ей настоящую жизнь..."

Now we have 99 other book recommendations from the Thin White Duke.\n\nMr. Bowie's archivist sent the list of favorite books to the curators of ""David Bowie Is,"" a sprawling exhibition that recently moved from the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, where it originated, to the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto.\n\nThere's some poetry on the list, a bit of Russian and German history, and a collection of Paris Review interviews. But Mr. Bowie appears to value fiction and music writing above all else. Classics on the list include Madame Bovary, As I Lay Dying and Lolita. Martin Amis (Money) and Evelyn Waugh (Vile Bodies) are joined by a slew of American writers, from Kerouac, Capote, Bellow and Fitzgerald to Don DeLillo (White Noise), Michael Chabon (Wonder Boys) and Junot Díaz (The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao). His preferred books about music also skew American: Sweet Soul Music by Peter Guralnick, The Life and Times of Little Richard by Charles White and Mystery Train by Greil Marcus, to name just three.\n\nGiven Mr Bowie's cultivated androgynous image, readers may be surprised to learn that only 12 of the 100 books were written by women. They will be less surprised that one of those 12 is Camille Paglia's Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson.\n\nElsewhere, there's Dante's Inferno, Homer's Iliad and The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind by Julian Jaynes. As the AV Club put it: ""David Bowie has once again shown that he's not only far richer, sexier and more fabulous than you, but probably smarter.""\n\n \n\nDavid Bowie's top 100 must read books:\n\nThe Age of American Unreason, Susan Jacoby, 2008\n\nThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot Díaz, 2007\n\nThe Coast of Utopia (trilogy), Tom Stoppard, 2007\n\nTeenage: The Creation of Youth 1875-1945, Jon Savage, 2007\n\nFingersmith, Sarah Waters, 2002\n\nThe Trial of Henry Kissinger, Christopher Hitchens, 2001\n\nMr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder, Lawrence Weschler, 1997\n\nA People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1890-1924, Orlando Figes, 1997\n\nThe Insult, Rupert Thomson, 1996\n\nWonder Boys, Michael Chabon, 1995\n\nThe Bird Artist, Howard Norman, 1994\n\nKafka Was The Rage: A Greenwich Village Memoir, Anatole Broyard, 1993\n\nBeyond the Brillo Box: The Visual Arts in Post-Historical Perspective, Arthur C.

But since then, Tyson has also spoken to the New York Times Sunday Book Review about some additional literary recommendations.\n\nAnd when it comes to book that have had the most impact on him, he lists One, Two, Three… Infinity by George Gamow and Edward Kasner and James Newman’s Mathematics and the Imagination as seminal during his childhood.\n\n“For me, at middle-school age, they turned math and science into an intellectual playground that I never wanted to leave,” he told the New York Times.\n\nImportantly, for parents of younger kids who want to get their children interested in science, he recommends On the Day You Were Born, by Debra Frasier. “I’m often asked by publishers whether I will ever write a science-based children’s book. My answer will remain no until I believe I can write one better than Frasier’s.""\n"

The Untethered Soul gets right down to business answering some of the deepest, soul searching questions I'd had for years but didn't know whom to ask. It's almost as if the author has seen into the inner-workings of my mind!\nWith very straight forward examples, the book emphasizes the pitfalls of relying on the mind to come up with ideas for making ourselves happy. The book points out that relying on the outside world for inner happiness just simply doesn't work. Happiness comes to us when we change and let go of ourselves at the deepest, innermost-level rather than changing the world outside.\n\nThe Untethered Soul helps to explain the crazy world around us where the unhampered ego creates conflict. This book is a step-by-step guide to the letting go of the ego - a process that may seem counter-intuitive initially, but ultimately leads to freedom from the nagging mind and heavy heart and directs you to the beauty of the self within.\n\nThe chapter on Contemplating Death has made me truly appreciate each living moment. I no longer want to waste time on energy depleting thoughts and feelings.\n\nI am grateful that Michael Singer has written a book so deep that it could actually make a difference in people's lives and help to make the world a better place to live.\n\nConsider yourself warned! Once you read this book, there is no turning back from The Untethered Soul within."

"Books to read","alcohol books to read periodically","After I'd been sober a while I was lucky enough to be sent a review copy of 'Recover to Live' by Christopher Kennedy Lawford. It is bloody marvellous resource and exactly what I was looking for when I first got sober and was frantically looking around for books and information to educate myself about alcohol addiction. This book  is a massive tome bursting at the seams with loads of information from so many clever, educated and knowledgeable recovery experts. If you have a question about anything to do with addiction the answer will be here. It's great. And I really like that it calls itself a 'self-treatment guide' as self-treatment is all I've been doing. Actually that's a big fat lie. Self treatment and the undisputed, undeniable, unbelievable support of a community of online bloggers and readers.  Kudos to you lot too. 'Moments of Clarity' by Christopher Kennedy Lawford is also very good.\n\nAugusten Burroughs brilliant memoir ""Dry"" I got a lot out of.  Bloody brilliant, really recommended it.  A great story well told.  Ripping through the story of his terrible boozing, being sent into rehab by his employer, going through rehab, home and into recovery, a shocking relapse finishing with recovery mark 2 (which, from looking at his website, has lasted to this day).  Such a great story and heaps of insights into rehab and AA and stuff that I'm not doing giving I'm reshaping my new sober life on my own.  He reveals a counsellor telling him to 'tell on your addict.' Apparently you need to visualise your own internal addict.  Think of it as a separate 'being' that lives inside of you. And it wants nothing more than for you to drink.  It's that whole 'only as dark as your secrets' thing or whatever that saying is.  I also learnt from this book about Pink Clouds, the wonderful feeling in early recovery when it all starts clicking and the using days seem far behind and life is just great great great.  I think the Pink Clouds come and go actually.  Also learnt from this book about warnings of a 9-month point in recovery when lots of people relapse.\n\n""Unwasted: My Lush Sobriety"" by Sacha Scoblic,  I practically read the damn thing in one sitting.  Seriously.  Yes this book is as good as everyone says.  She just writes so well and so punchily.  It motors along and probably about 250 times I was thinking - yup, me too.  There was so much that I could relate to; when she described how she drank and why she drank, and what a reliance on alcohol is all about, and what becoming sober is like.  It's very good. \n\nI speed-read ""Smashed: Growing Up A Drunk Girl"" by Koren Zailckas. A great read if you want to read all about someone's crazy boozy exploits (and boy did she have some crazy boozy exploits). As seems to often be the way with these memoirs the bit where she got sober was pretty brief (this is always what I want to read about) but she does sum up nicely what she has learned about herself since she took the booze away (a lot, and not all of it peaches and roses). She ends up by railing against the alcohol industry; ""which alternates between pandering to women and using us to bait men"" and with a great feminist rant about all of the evils alcohol creates for women; ""I've had it with a world that has created a generation of women who are emotionally dependent on alcohol"". And then there's this: ""I'm tired of the world that won't rescue girls until we're long past the point of saving. Too many people rely on outward signs of aggression to indicate their daughters or girlfriends or sisters have problems with alcohol. They wait for fights, or D.U.I charges, or destruction of property, when girls who drink are far less apt to break rules in overt ways. As a gender we are far more likely to turn our own drunken destructiveness inward, to wage private wars against ourselves, to attempt suicide, to be pinned down by fear and depression. So very true, remove the alcohol and we un-pin ourselves and really start to live. \n\n""Mackenzie Phillips ""High on Arrival"". That woman is living breathing proof of just how much a human body can take.  It's quite a dark read of drugs, drugs, drugs.  Sad, intense, prolonged drug taking.  Her dad clearly had no moral compass whatsoever so from a young age she was pretty stuffed.  When writing about what she learned at her final rehab, and what hadn't worked with previous rehabs which led to relapses, she said; '..maybe what I'd also gotten wrong was that I couldn't throw away who I was to be clean.  It sounds corny, but what I realised was that I could still be my quirky left-of-centre self without doing drugs.'\n\n'A Piece of Cake' by Cupcake Brown which I finished in tears, and felt all inspired by, is similarly hard-core. You must read this memoir!!! What an amazing story of a woman who drank and drugged from the age of 11 until her late 20's when she turned her life around. I could not put it down. Harrowing yet wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. So life-affirming and powerful - how to turn even the shittiest life around. I do so recommend it.\n\n'All or Nothing' by Jesse Schenker is a rip-snorter of a memoir by a very successful young chef in the States. This is one of those books you read and can't believe that the author made it out of their debauchery alive let alone with enough brain cells to actually write a book! Boy was he big into pills & needles etc. It rips along and is really compelling, he seems very honest and upfront. I would have liked more about the getting-sober process and what it's like to be in recovery and how he works at it but that's always how I feel after reading a lot of these memoirs. Still a great read.\n\nReally enjoyed 'Happy Accidents' by Jane Lynch the coach from Glee.  It was the fact that she lives sober now that got me to her book, I always like reading about other people's paths to sobriety.  She says she was 'struck sober' one day.  I thought that was cool.  Once she decided to stop she just stopped, went to AA for a long time but doesn't any more because she feels she's locked in her non-drinking habit.  I love that her mind seems like a steel trap that she can exercise at will and bend to form the new habits she wants to form.  She's a woman totally in control of her own life.  Cool!\n\n'Unhooked: How to quit anything' by Dr Frederick Woolverton and Susan Shapiro I really really enjoyed.  He's quite a full on addiction therapist who doesn't believe in pussy-footing around people who are seriously hooked on a substance.  He's really blunt and gets really stuck in with practical and direct instructions for people who need help re-learning how to live without their crutch of choice.  He's got these really meaty case-studies (he says they're stories of past patients but I'm sure they're made up) to help illustrate the point he's making in each chapter.  Great reading for someone like me who is addicted to stories of recovery. One of his big recommendations to patients wanting to quit an addiction is to start writing every day.  Write your feelings, your food and drug intake, your plans, dreams, hopes, frustrations, favorite songs.  He says write write write, be honest and write. He says ""It is my belief that you cannot successfully treat an addiction without confronting the deep, emotional issues that are giving rise to the substance abuse in the first place.  If you do not dig deeply enough into the roots of the behavior, you will either start using again, or you will switch vices sometimes without even realizing it.""\n\nAndrew Weil and others wrote in 'From Chocolate to Morphine'; ""We think that addiction is a basic human problem whose roots go very deep.  Most of us have at some point been wounded, no matter what kind of family we grew up in or what kind of society we live in.  We long for a sense of completeness and wholeness and whatever satisfaction we gain from drugs, food, sex, money, and other ""sources"" of pleasure really comes from inside of us.  That is, we project our power onto external substances and activities, allowing them to make us feel better temporarily.  This is a very strange sort of magic.  We give away our power in exchange for a transient sense of wholeness, then suffer bec"

"Books to read","jacob:","This review is from: Jacob Have I Loved (Mass Market Paperback)\nI have been a writer for 25 years. I have an 8-year-old daughter who loves to read, and I've recently been reading books to see if they are beyond her reading abilities. I was incredibly moved and amazed at this book. I don't think that my daughter can read it on her own yet, and I may try to read it with her....but I know that in a few years this book can open her heart in the same way that it did mine. This is the kind of book that is life-changing and life-affirming. It's honest, gorgeously written, funny, unbearably sad, and ultimately uplifting. A true classic."

It doesn't end when the main character no longer is introverted, but celebrates her inner roar and shows that she can make friends and do all her favorite things--in her own way. Favorite quote: ""There's nothing wrong with being quiet even in a monster hat. I feel my roar inside."" It also has really cool illustrations."

"Books to read","The Mythical Man-Month - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering is a book on software engineering and project management by Fred Brooks, whose central theme is that ""adding manpower to a late software project makes it later"". This idea is known as Brooks' law, and is presented along with the second-system effect and advocacy of prototyping.\nBrooks' observations are based on his experiences at IBM while managing the development of OS/360. He had added more programmers to a project falling behind schedule, a decision that he would later counter-intuitively conclude to have delayed the project even further. He also made the mistake of asserting that one project — writing an ALGOL compiler — would require six months, regardless of the number of workers involved (it required longer). The tendency for managers to repeat such errors in project development led Brooks to quip that his book is called ""The Bible of Software Engineering"", because ""everybody quotes it, some people read it, and a few people ... \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month"

While drawing liberally from the artist’s famously eloquent letters, they have also delved into hundreds of unpublished family correspondences, illuminating with poignancy the wanderings of Van Gogh’s troubled, restless soul. Naifeh and Smith bring a crucial understanding to the larger-than-life mythology of this great artist—his early struggles to find his place in the world; his intense relationship with his brother Theo; his impetus for turning to brush and canvas; and his move to Provence, where in a brief burst of incandescent productivity he painted some of the best-loved works in Western art.\n\nThe authors also shed new light on many unexplored aspects of Van Gogh’s inner world: his deep immersion in literature and art; his erratic and tumultuous romantic life; and his bouts of depression and mental illness."

As they drive towards the fulfillment of their mission, their errand becomes an extraordinary journey into their collective and individual pasts. Braiding these men's voices, and that of Jack's widow, into a choir of sorrow and resentment, passion and regret, Swift creates a testament to a changing England and to enduring mortality."
"Books to read","Summerscale, Kate: Mrs. Robinson's Disgrace: The Private Diary of a Victorian Lady","""I think people marry far too much; it is such a lottery, and for a poor woman—bodily and morally the husband’s slave—a very doubtful happiness."" —Queen Victoria to her recently married daughter Vicky\n\nHeadstrong, high-spirited, and already widowed, Isabella Walker became Mrs. Henry Robinson at age 31 in 1844. Her first husband had died suddenly, leaving his estate to a son from a previous marriage, so she inherited nothing. A successful civil engineer, Henry moved them, by then with two sons, to Edinburgh’s elegant society in 1850. But Henry traveled often and was cold and remote when home, leaving Isabella to her fantasies.\n\nNo doubt thousands of Victorian women faced the same circumstances, but Isabella chose to record her innermost thoughts—and especially her infatuation with a married Dr. Edward Lane—in her diary. Over five years the entries mounted—passionate, sensual, suggestive. One fateful day in 1858 Henry chanced on the diary and, broaching its privacy, read Isabella's intimate entries. Aghast at his wife’s perceived infidelity, Henry petitioned for divorce on the grounds of adultery. Until that year, divorce had been illegal in England, the marital bond being a cornerstone of English life. Their trial would be a cause celebre, threatening the foundations of Victorian society with the specter of ""a new and disturbing figure: a middle class wife who was restless, unhappy, avid for arousal."" Her diary, read in court, was as explosive as Flaubert’s Madame Bovary, just published in France but considered too scandalous to be translated into English until the 1880s."

From that moment, the rules by which A has been living no longer apply. Because finally A has found someone he wants to be with—day in, day out, day after day."

Wry, courtly, opinionated, and completely endearing, the Major leads a quiet life valuing the proper things that Englishmen have lived by for generations: honor, duty, decorum, and a properly brewed cup of tea. But then his brother’s death sparks an unexpected friendship with Mrs. Jasmina Ali, the Pakistani shopkeeper from the village. Drawn together by their shared love of literature and the loss of their spouses, the Major and Mrs. Ali soon find their friendship blossoming into something more. But village society insists on embracing him as the quintessential local and regarding her as the permanent foreigner. Can their relationship survive the risks one takes when pursuing happiness in the face of culture and tradition?"

While Derek remains seasick and cabin-bound, Elizabeth wanders the ship, alternately avoiding and seeking out Arthur. Unable to avoid memories of their fractured past, she must face the deception they practiced even as she accepts the peace they brought to the grief-stricken who sought their services."

The once-great city of Bohane on the west coast of Ireland is on its knees, infested by vice and split along tribal lines. There are the posh parts of town, but it is in the slums and backstreets of Smoketown, the tower blocks of the North Rises, and the eerie bogs of the Big Nothin’ that the city really lives. For years it has all been under the control of Logan Hartnett, the dapper godfather of the Hartnett Fancy gang. But there’s trouble in the air. They say Hartnett’s old nemesis is back in town; his trusted henchmen are getting ambitious; and his missus wants him to give it all up and go straight."

A man is booted out of his home after his wife discovers that the print of a bare foot on the inside of his car's windshield doesn't match her own.  Teenage cousins, drugged by summer, meet with a reckoning in the woods.  A boy runs off to the carnival after his stepfather bites him in a brawl.  Wells Tower's version of America is touched with the seamy splendor of the dropout, the misfit: failed inventors, boozy dreamers, hapless fathers, wayward sons."

The narrators of these delicate, dangerous, and sometimes deeply funny stories tell us what they believe to be important-in language inflected with the landscape's own understatement-while the real stories lie in what they unwittingly let slip."

"Books to read","Self, Will: Umbrella","Radical and uncompromising, Umbrella is a tour de force from one of England’s most acclaimed contemporary writers, and Self’s most ambitious novel to date. Moving between Edwardian London and a suburban mental hospital in 1971, Umbrella exposes the twentieth century’s technological searchlight as refracted through the dark glass of a long term mental institution. While making his first tours of the hospital at which he has just begun working, maverick psychiatrist Zachary Busner notices that many of the patients exhibit a strange physical tic: rapid, precise movements that they repeat over and over. One of these patients is Audrey Dearth, an elderly woman born in the slums of West London in 1890. Audrey’s memories of a bygone Edwardian London, her lovers, involvement with early feminist and socialist movements, and, in particular, her time working in an umbrella shop, alternate with Busner’s attempts to treat her condition and bring light to her clouded world. Busner’s investigations into Audrey’s illness lead to discoveries about her family that are shocking and tragic."

"Books to read","Schlink, Bernhard: Summer Lies (ss)","From Bernhard Schlink, the internationally best-selling author of The Reader, come seven provocative and masterfully calibrated stories. A keen dissection of the ways in which we play with truth and less-than-truth in our lives. Summer Lies brims with the delusions, the passions, the outbursts, and the sometimes irrational justifications people make within a mélange of beautifully rendered relationships. In ”After the Season,” a man falls quickly in love with a woman he meets on the beach but wrestles with his incongruous feelings of betrayal after he learns she’s rich. In “Johann Sebastian Bach on Ruegen,” a son tries to put his resentment toward his emotionally distant father behind him by proposing a trip to a Back festival but soon realizes, during his efforts to reconnect, that it wasn’t his father who was the distant one. A philandering playwright is accused to infidelity by his wife in “The Night in Baden-Baden,” but he sees her accusations as nothing more than a means to exculpate himself of his guilt as he carries on with his ways. And in “Stranger in the Night,” an obliging professor becomes an accomplice—not entirely unwittingly—to the temporary escape of a charismatic fugitive on a delayed flight from New York to Frankfurt.\n \nThe truth, as once character puts it, is “passionate, beautiful sometimes, and sometimes hideous, it can make you happy and it can torture you, and it always sets you free.” Tantalizingly, so is the act of telling a lie—to others and to ourselves."
"Books to read","Kinney, Anne-Marie: Radio Iris","Radio Iris follows Iris Finch, a twentysomething socially awkward daydreamer and receptionist at Larmax, Inc., a company whose true function she doesn’t understand (though she’s heard her boss refer to himself as “a businessman”).\n\nGradually, her boss’ erratic behavior becomes even more erratic, her coworkers begin disappearing, the phone stops ringing, making her role at Larmax moot, and a mysterious man appears to be living in the office suite next door."
"Books to read","Johnson, Denis: Train Dreams","Denis Johnson’s Train Dreams is an epic in miniature, one of his most evocative and poignant fictions. It is the story of Robert Grainier, a day laborer in the American West at the start of the twentieth century---an ordinary man in extraordinary times. Buffeted by the loss of his family, Grainer struggles to make sense of this strange new world. As his story unfolds, we witness both his shocking personal defeats and the radical changes that transform America in his lifetime. Suffused with the history and landscapes of the American West, this novella by the National Book Award--winning author of Tree of Smoke captures the disappearance of a distinctly American way of life."

In the heat of a hospital laundry room in New Jersey, a woman does her lover’s washing and thinks about his wife. In Boston, a man buys his love child, his only son, a first baseball bat and glove. At the heart of these stories is the irrepressible, irresistible Yunior, a young hardhead whose longing for love is equaled only by his recklessness--and by the extraordinary women he loves and loses: artistic Alma; the aging Miss Lora; Magdalena, who thinks all Dominican men are cheaters; and the love of his life, whose heartbreak ultimately becomes his own."

But after his release, a surprising offer from his father draws him home.

Could each be exactly what the other needs?"
"Books to read","Chabon, Michael: Yiddish Policemen's Union","For sixty years Jewish refugees and their descendants have prospered in the Federal District of Sitka, a ""temporary"" safe haven created in the wake of the Holocaust and the shocking 1948 collapse of the fledgling state of Israel. The Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. But now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end. \n\nHomicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. And in the cheap hotel where Landsman has washed up, someone has just committed a murder—right under his nose. When he begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy, word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, and Landsman finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, evil, and salvation that are his heritage."
"Books to read","Boo, Kate: Behind the Beautiful Forevers","Annawadi is a makeshift settlement in the shadow of luxury hotels near the Mumbai airport, and as India starts to prosper, Annawadians are electric with hope. Abdul, a reflective and enterprising Muslim teenager, sees “a fortune beyond counting” in the recyclable garbage that richer people throw away. Asha, a woman of formidable wit and deep scars from a childhood in rural poverty, has identified an alternate route to the middle class: political corruption. With a little luck, her sensitive, beautiful daughter—Annawadi’s “most-everything girl”—will soon become its first female college graduate. And even the poorest Annawadians, like Kalu, a fifteen-year-old scrap-metal thief, believe themselves inching closer to the good lives and good times they call “the full enjoy.” \n \nBut then Abdul the garbage sorter is falsely accused in a shocking tragedy; terror and a global recession rock the city; and suppressed tensions over religion, caste, sex, power and economic envy turn brutal. As the tenderest individual hopes intersect with the greatest global truths, the true contours of a competitive age are revealed. And so, too, are the imaginations and courage of the people of Annawadi."

"Books to read","O'Malley, Thomas: This Magnificent Desolation","Duncan's entire world is the orphanage where he lives, a solitary outpost on the open plains of northern Minnesota. Aged ten in 1980, he has no memories of his life before now, but he has stories that he recites like prayers: the story of how his mother brought him here during the worst blizzard of the century; the story of how God spoke to him at his birth and gave him a special purpose.\n\nDuncan is sure that his mother is dead until the day she turns up to claim him. Maggie Bright, a soprano who was once the talent of her generation, now sings in a San Francisco bar through a haze of whisky cut with sharp regret. She often finishes up in the arms of Joshua McGreevey, a Vietnam vet who earns his living as part of a tunneling crew seventy feet beneath the Bay. He smells of sea silt and loam, as if he has been dredged from the deep bottom of the world - and his wounds run deep too.\n\nThrown into this mysterious adult world, Duncan finds comfort in an ancient radio, from which tumble the voices of Apollo mission astronauts who never came home, and dreams of finding his real father."

The corporate clients are more than happy to let someone else handle their emotional dirty work, making Sorry an instant success.\n \nBut one client hides a darker agenda. Expecting an ordinary apology job, Wolf is dispatched to the scene of a crime. In an abandoned apartment, there is a dead woman nailed to the wall. Then his phone rings and the nightmare begins: The client wants to make sure his apology is properly delivered."

Her family owns the Cherry County Playhouse, and more than anything, Elsa relishes appearing onstage, where she soaks up the approval of her father and the embrace of the audience. But when tragedy strikes her family, her acting becomes more than a child¹s game of pretend.\n\nWhile still in her teens, Elsa marries and flees to Los Angeles. There she is discovered by Irving Green, one of the most powerful executives in Hollywood, who refashions her as a serious, exotic brunette and renames her Laura Lamont. Irving becomes Laura’s great love; she becomes an Academy Award­-winning actress—and a genuine movie star. Laura experiences all the glamour and extravagance of the heady pinnacle of stardom in the studio-system era, but ultimately her story is a timeless one of a woman trying to balance career, family, and personal happiness, all while remaining true to herself."

Devereaux's reluctance is partly rooted in his character--he is a born anarchist-- and partly in the fact that his department is more savagely divided than the Balkans.  \n\nIn the course of a single week, Devereaux will have his nose mangled by an angry colleague, imagine his wife is having an affair with his dean, wonder if a curvaceous adjunct is trying to seduce him with peach pits, and threaten to execute a goose on local television.  All this while coming to terms with his philandering father, the dereliction of his youthful promise, and the ominous failure of certain vital body functions."

"Books to read","The Jungle - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","For other uses, see Jungle (disambiguation).\n\nThe Jungle is a 1906 novel written by the American journalist and novelist Upton Sinclair (1878–1968). Sinclair wrote the novel to portray the lives of immigrants in the United States. Many readers were most concerned with his exposure of practices in the American meatpacking industry during the early 20th century, based on an investigation he did for a socialist newspaper.\nThe book depicts poverty, the absence of social programs, unpleasant living and working conditions, and the hopelessness prevalent among the working class, which is contrasted with the deeply rooted corruption of people in power. A review by the writer Jack London called it, ""the Uncle Tom's Cabin of wage slavery.""\nSinclair was considered a muckraker, or journalist who exposed corruption in government and business. He first published the novel in serial form in 1905 in the socialist newspaper, Appeal to Reason, between February 25, 1905, and November 4, 1905. In 1904, Si... \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle"

"Books to read","Bill Gates recommends","A few hours ago, Bill Gates blogged his suggestions for summer reading. His previous year's suggestions were somewhat weighty tomes, but this year, he's suggesting books that he characterizes as ""beach reading."" Here are his picks:\n\nHyperbole and a Half, by Allie Brosh\nGates comments: ""Based on Brosh'swildly popular website, [the book] consists of brief vignettes and comic drawings about her young life. The adventures she recounts are mostly inside her head, where we hear and see the kind of inner thoughts most of us are too timid to let out in public.\n""The Magic of Reality, by Richard Dawkins\nGates comments: ""An engaging, well-illustrated science textbook offering compelling answers to big questions [and] a plea for readers of all ages to approach mysteries with rigor and curiosity.\n\n""What If?, by Randall Munroe\nGates comments: ""People write Munroe with odd questions about science. Munroe's explanations are funny, but the science underpinning his answers is very accurate [and] you'll also learn a bit about things like ballistics, DNA, the oceans, the atmosphere, and lightning.\n\n""xkcd: volume 0, by Randall Munroe\nGates comments: ""A collection of posts from Munroe's blog XKCD, which is made up of cartoons he draws making fun of things--mostly scientists and computers, but lots of other things too.\n\n""On Immunity, by Eula Biss\nGates comments: ""Biss examines what lies behind people's fears of vaccinating their children. Like many of us, she concludes that vaccines are safe, effective, and almost miraculous.... But she is not out to demonize anyone who holds opposing views.\n\n""How to Lie with Statistics, by Darrell Huff\nGates comments: ""Shows you how visuals can be used to exaggerate trends and give distorted comparisons--a timely reminder, given how often infographics show up.... [It's also an] introduction to the use of statistics, and a helpful refresher for anyone who is already well versed in it.\n\n""Should We Eat Meat?, by Vaclav Smil\nGates comments: ""The richer the world gets, the more meat it eats. And the more meat it eats, the bigger the threat to the planet.... I don't think we can expect large numbers of people to make drastic reductions [so] I'm betting on innovation, including higher agricultural productivity and the development of meat substitutes.""\n\nOf the seven Gates picked, two are among my favorite books. I recently recommended How to Lie with Statistics as one of ""7 Short Books Worth More Than an MBA,"" and The Magic of Reality is the next book I'm reading to my 10-year-old son at bedtime.\n\nBased on Gates's comments, I can tell that the other five are right up my alley, too. In fact, when I started writing this post, I checked out the two blogs he linked to and I got distracted from writing, which is why I'm posting this in the middle of the night!\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs I think about the list, what strikes me as important isn't so much the books themselves but that Gates chooses to share his reading habits with the world. I mean, it's not as if he has anything to prove.\n\nConsider: Gates is the richest man in the world with a net worth exceeding $80 billion. He doesn't need to make himself more popular by recommending books. That he spends the time and effort to do so sets him apart from his financial peers.\n\nIn the past (and indeed still today), most ultra-wealthy moguls either obsessively seek additional wealth or withdraw into a cocoon of privilege, like Howard Hughes, the du Pont heirs, and William Randolph Hearst (a.k.a. Citizen Kane).\n\nSome do become philanthropists, but often their giving goes towards charities like art museums or their alma maters, charities that keep the money benefiting their own personal circle of privilege.\n\nGates, on the other hand, has spent his money on projects like eradicating malaria, where the only thanks he'll ever get is from the desperately poor of the world. He's honestly trying to make the world a better place. In this case, one reader at a time.\n\nAs I look over his list, what impresses me most is how much Gates has grown as an individual. When I interviewed him back during his Microsoft years, he was all about the business of technology. Today, he's like the mentor we all wish we had.\n\nSo much energy in business today is all about the push-push-push for success, so it's refreshing to see an icon of entrepreneurship who no longer needs to posture or preen but instead wants to share, wisely and well, what he's acquired and learned.\n\n "

"Books to read","Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt is a 1926 book by the Nobel prize-winning chemist Frederick Soddy on monetary policy and society and the role of energy in economic systems. Soddy criticized the focus on monetary flows in economics, arguing that “real” wealth was derived from the use of energy to transform materials into physical goods and services. Soddy’s economic writings were largely ignored in his time, but would later be applied to the development of ecological economics in the late 20th century.\n\nContents\n [hide] 1 Real wealth and virtual wealth\n2 Quote\n3 See also\n4 References\n5 External links\n\nReal wealth and virtual wealth[edit source | editbeta]\nIn his 1926 book Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt: The Solution of the Economic Paradox (a book that presaged the market crash of 1929) Soddy pointed out the fundamental difference between real wealth – buildings, machinery, oil, pigs – and virtual wealth, in the form of money and debt.

""The Dream Songs"". 1969.","The Dream Songs is a compilation of two books of poetry, 77 Dream Songs (1964) and His Toy, His Dream, His Rest (1968) by the American poet, John Berryman. According to Berryman's ""Note"" to The Dream Songs, ""This volume combines 77 Dream Songs and His Toy, His Dream, His Rest, comprising Books I through VII of a poem whose working title, since 1955, has been The Dream Songs."" So as this note indicates, Berryman clearly intended the two books to be read as a single work. In total, the work consists of 385 individual poems.\nThe book is listed on the American Academy of Poets website as one of their Groundbreaking Books of the 20th Century. The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry editors call The Dream Songs, ""[John Berryman's] major work"" and they go on to note that ""[the poems] form, like his friend Robert Lowell's Notebook, a poetic journal, and represent half phantasmagorically, the changes in Berryman's mood and attitude.""\nThe dream song form consists of three stanzas, divided into six... \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dream_Songs"

"Books to read","Нобелевские лауреаты","10 великолепных романов Нобелевских лауреатов \n\n1. Жозе Сарамаго — ""Слепота""\nЖозе Сарамаго - крупнейший писатель современной Португалии, лауреат Нобелевской премии по литературе (1998). \nЖителей безымянного города безымянной страны поражает загадочная эпидемия слепоты. В попытке сдержать ее распространение власти вводят строжайший карантин и принимаются переселять всех заболевших в пустующую загородную больницу под присмотр армии. Главные герои романа - не уберегшийся от болезни врач-окулист и его жена, имитирующая слепоту, чтобы остаться с мужем, - ищут крупицы порядка в мире, который неудержимо скатывается в хаос... \n\n2. Эльфрида Елинек — ""Пианистка""\n\nРоман ""Пианистка"" (1983), имевший сенсационный успех в Европе и США, - знаковое произведение современной литературы, впервые выходящее на русском языке. А экранизация ""Пианистки"", переосмысленной знаменитым режиссером Михаэлем Ханеке, получившая Гран-При на Каннском фестивале 2001 года и неофициальный статус ""первого значительного произведения киноискусства нового столетия"", с триумфом шествует по экранам Европы.\n\n3. Джон Максвелл Кутзее — ""Бесчестье""\n\nСамый загадочный писатель из всех нобелевских лауреатов, дважды удостоенный премии ""Букер"" и ни разу не явившийся на вручение, посвятивший нобелевскую речь не кому-нибудь, а Робинзону Крузо, человек, само имя которого долго оставалось загадкой.\n""Бесчестье"" - возможно, главный роман писателя. Герой книги, университетский профессор, из-за скандальной истории со студенткой лишается буквально всего - и работы, и благорасположения общества.\nРоман-полемика, ответ писателя на вопрос, в свое время поставленный Францем Кафкой, - быть или не быть человеку, если жизнь низвела его в глазах окружающих до состояния насекомого, стать ли ему нулем или начать с нуля.\n\n4. Имре Кертес — ""Без судьбы""\n\nРоман лауреата Нобелевской премии, венгерского писателя Имре Кертеса ""Без судьбы"" во многом автобиографичен. Как и юный герой романа, Кертес пятнадцатилетним мальчиком попал в гитлеровские лагеря. Ему повезло - в отличие от миллионов жертв Холокоста он, пройдя Освенцим и Бухенвальд, остался жив.\nМногие писатели пытались и еще будут пытаться подвести итоги XX века с его трагизмом и взлетами человеческого духа, итоги века, показавшего людям, что такое Холокост. Но так, как это сделал Имре Кертес, не смог, кажется, сделать пока никто.\n\n5. Томас Манн — ""Волшебная гора""\n\nИстория об обитателях дорогого туберкулезного санатория в Швейцарских Альпах, где время течет незаметно, жизнь и смерть как бы утрачивают смысл и значимость, а мельчайшие нюансы человеческих отношений, напротив, приобретают болезненную остроту. \nЛюбовь, веселье, дружба, вражда, ревность - для обитателей санатория все эти чувства словно отмечены тенью небытия. \nКто-то из них выздоровеет и навсегда покинет Альпы. Кто-то умрет. \nНо никто еще не знает, какой будет его судьба...\n\n6. Кнут Гамсун — ""Голод""\n\nСамый безжалостный из романов Кнута Гамсуна.\nСтрашная в своей простоте история молодого, непризнанного писателя.\nОн слишком горд, чтобы просить о помощи. Он по-прежнему надеется на чудо.\nДень за днем он все глубже погружается в пучину голодного психоза - и уже с трудом отличает бред от реальности.\nОн погибнет - и мир даже не вспомнит о нем...\nИли чудо все-таки случится?\n\n7. Гюнтер Грасс — ""Жестняной барабан""\n\n""Жестяной барабан"" - первый роман знаменитого немецкого писателя, лауреата Нобелевской премии (1999) Гюнтера Грасса. Именно это произведение, в гротесковом виде отразившее историю Германии XX века, принесло своему автору мировую известность.\n\n8. Генрих Бёлль — ""Глазами клоуна""\n\nОт него ушла жена, он потерял работу... Пожалуй, даже не из-за травмы, а потому, что упал на глазах у публики. ""Людей ничто так не обескураживает, как клоун, вызывающий жалость. Это все равно, как если бы вам подал пиво официант в инвалидной коляске...""\nЛисток с телефонами как обещание спасения... Обзванивая всех, он вспоминает свою жизнь: богатство и бедность, радость и печаль, потери и обретения. Одни и те же люди, меняющиеся в зависимости от ситуации. Перед ним жизнь, как на ладони, и он совсем один. Помогут ли ему вера и религия? Это произведение насыщено чувствами и каждое воспоминание героя - своеобразный крик.\nЭто очень грустная, по-настоящему грустная и светлая книга.\nМожет быть, нам стоит еще раз взглянуть на жизнь глазами клоуна.\nКлоуна, коллекционирующего мгновения?\n\n9. Элиас Канетти — ""Ослепление""\n\n`Душа есть лишнее слово для обозначения чего - то в теле` - утверждает Ф. Ницше. Этот постулат лежит, похоже, в основе поведения героев романа Э. Канетти `Ослепление`.\nСобытия, разворачивающиеся в романе, имеют аналогию и с нашим временем: нормальность действующих лиц носит сомнительный характер и постоянно готова обернуться сумасшествием, вылиться в жуткие формы массового психоза.\nРоман `Ослепление` был написан в 1931 году, а спустя пятьдесят лет, в 1981 году, автор удостоился высшей награды - Нобелевской премии.\n\n10. Габриэль Гарсия Маркес — ""Вспоминая моих грустных шлюх""\n\nДолгожданная книга, написанная после двадцатилетнего молчания. \nЭта книга - о любви. О любви, настигшей человека в конце жизни, которую он прожил бездарно, растрачивая тело на безлюбый секс и не затрачивая души. Любовь, случившаяся с ним, гибельна и прекрасна, она наполняет его существование смыслом, открывает ему иное видение привычных вещей и вдыхает живое тепло в его, ставшую холодным ремеслом профессию. \nИ еще эта книга - о старости. О той поре, когда желания еще живы, а силы уже на исходе, и человеку остается последняя мудрость - увидеть без прикрас и обманных иллюзий всю красоту, жестокость и невозвратную быстротечность жизни.\n\n#книги@yakor.blog"

"Books to read","Competent is not an option","by Art Turock\n\nContent Guy's Note: I'm not big on consultants as contributing columnists. To be honest, it always feels like they're selling something. Plus, there are websites out there that specialize in consultant commentary. That's a perfectly legitimate business model. Just not mine.\n\nHowever, today I'm making an exception. Art Turock is a leadership development coach with considerable experience and, more importantly, a unique perspective - he's focused, among other things, on the player development tactics of Pete Carroll, who will lead the Seattle Seahawks into battle on Sunday against the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl. Art has a new book out - ""Competent Is Not An Option,"" which is available from Amazon by clicking on the book cover at left - and in view of the Seahawks' return to the Super Bowl after winning the championship last year, I asked Art to offer what I think is a timely and unique perspective. Enjoy.\n\n“How do we develop leaders who are A-players when there’s barely enough time to get the day’s work done?”\n\nThis question poses a dilemma business leaders view as an insurmountable problem inherent with being in business. Solve that dilemma, and you change the game. A game-changer opportunity requires looking in a different direction than your competition. One place to look for solutions is in a disparate field such as sports, where a coach’s top priority is developing an elite performing team.\n\nI’ve been privileged to learn leadership development lessons from Super Bowl winning Head Coach Pete Carroll of the Seattle Seahawks. While Carroll coached the USC Trojans in 2006-2009, I immersed myself in coaching clinics and watching team practices. Over the next five years, I’ve adapted the best principles from his player development process to help my clients build all-star leadership teams. I’ve field-tested my adaptation, called the Learning-While-Working Process, in year-long leadership development projects, with food industry groups like Deschutes Brewery, Blue, Bunny, Hormel, and Doug’s Market (a two store grocery retailer in Minnesota).\n\nIn this article, I will share two vital lessons I learned from Coach Carroll and describe how food industry leaders can employ them in developing elite talent.\n\nLesson One: COMPETENT PERFORMANCE IS NOT AN OPTION. SET STANDARDS THAT DEFINE ELITE PERFORMANCE..\n\nCoach Carroll says, “If I was writing down the keys to our success, I would write one point: we’re going to do things better than they have ever been done before. We are going to teach, practice, recruit, counsel, analyze, and do everything better than it has ever been done before.”\n\nAt first, I relegated Coach Carroll’s outrageous “best-it’s-ever-been-done” standard as the ranting of a Baby-Boomer coach, who never met a positive-thinking course he didn’t like. College jocks who aspire to NFL careers will drink the Kool-Aid, but business executives never will.\n\nBut I gradually realized that unless leaders can conceive elite standards, then their team’s performance capacity will conform to an industry’s customary role descriptions.\n\nFor instance, what if the supermarket pharmacist wasn’t just a prescription filler? Elite pharmacists could reinvent their roles as cross selling specialists who recommend purchasing produce items and supplements which remedy depletion of vital nutrients caused by pharmaceutical drugs. What if sales reps weren’t merely pitch men offering up boilerplate presentations to extol their company’s brands and capabilities? Elite sales professionals provoke customers detect strategic blind spots and neglected growth opportunities, and then offer unique solutions they would never think to ask for. The goal is for customers to say, “I got so much value from that call, I would have paid for it.”\n\nOne of my coaching clients, Chuck Lindner, owner of Doug’s Markets’ requires every employee on the sales floor to track their daily add-on sales generated from offering extra service and relevant suggestions to shoppers.\n\nLesson Two: LEADERS ORCHESTRATE ELITE HABITS.\n\nFootball analysts disparage Pete Carroll’s coaching style as over-the-top positive and new age. Actually, he is old school - like ancient Greece. Coach Carroll frequently refers to a quote from Aristotle: “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.”\n\nHabits are reinforced patterns of behavior that are repeated regularly and occur subconsciously and are hard to give up. So habits occur effortlessly–for better or for worse, for excellent or for watered-down decent performance. In Pete Carroll’s coaching style, practice plays a vital role in instilling excellent habits. Any enduring habit consists of a triggering event, which activates a routine, which ultimately leads to a small win.\n\nA trigger is a cue to focus attention to the task at hand. For Carroll’s USC football team, one primary trigger was the day of the week, which calls for a specific practice routine. The practice regimen gets choreographed into a rhythm of varying intensity of physical and mental effort so the team’s performance peaks on game-days. \n\n""Tell the Truth Monday” calls for players and coaches to rigorously study game film and take accountability for problems and successes in their game plan execution to improve the next week’s performance. “Competition Tuesday” focuses on re-energizing players’ competitive instincts to bring ferocious engagement to the drills and scrimmaging. “Turnover Wednesday” casts attention on one single factor that contributes to winning or losing—ball control—to prevent the offensive team’s mistakes (like fumbles and interceptions) while the defensive team aims to cause opponents’ turnovers. “No Repeat Thursday”emphasizes flawless execution of the game plan. “Walk Through Friday” drastically slows down physical effort so players conserve energy while engaging in confidence-building rituals in final preparation for Saturday’s game. This weekly rhythm insures that learning the game plan, physical conditioning, and honing position-specific skills gets accomplished with no wasted effort.\n\nSmall wins reinforce the value of practice routines. Each impeccable repetition of an agility drill reflects increased athletic prowess. The coaching staff devises metrics to analyze practice and game film to measure players’ praiseworthy efforts and spot areas for improving movement and split second decision-making. Players get recognized for modeling the teams’ unwavering beliefs: no whining, always protect the team, or always compete.\n\nWhen Coach Carroll endorsed my ability to translate his player development process to business, he referred to my Learning-While-Working Process, which instills a rhythm for building capabilities while real work is getting done. The Learning-While-Working Process alters the habitual cadence of work from “getting tasks done efficiently” to “engaging customary tasks as learning occasions.” Excellent habits for leadership, customer service or selling can become as automatic as efficiency-driven habits like multi-tasking, winging-it, and micromanaging.\n\nThe rhythm to drive the Learning-While-Working Process comes from 5 triggering cues, called the 5Ps. Each of the 5Ps signals team members to choose from a number of time efficient, job-imbedded-development routines. In turn, each P triggers the next one, so there’s a rhythm to direct full engagement with potential learning opportunities designed into the work day.\n\nP1) Prepare: Move from presuming that basic leadership skills are already sufficiently mastered, to requiring clear defining and ongoing refining of basics.\n\nP2) Practice while real work gets done: Move from getting tasks done expediently, to consciously designing and improvising deliberate practice drills in the midst of daily tasks.\n\nP3) Perform in game-on situations: Move from simply going through the motions in getting a task done, to bringing second-nature proficiency to high-stakes situations for improving business results and enhancing learning outcomes (e.g. strategic planning, performance reviews).\n\nP4) Perfect the process: Move from expediently completing an activity, to scrutinizing the just-completed process, in order to extract every bit of learning possible.\n\nP5) Publicize fresh learning: Move from absorbing learning for your own consumption, to sharing learning generously with co-workers, trade association colleagues, LinkedIn group members, even customers. \n\nAny business leader who aspires to stage a game-changer innovation eventually discovers there is no choice but to seek an uncommon perspective and accompanying work process to leapfrog what’s already being done. In the same way Pete Carroll’s coaching style is called un-football-like, a truly game-changing work process will look un-businesslike since every possible minute isn’t devoted to getting work done efficiently.\n\nIf sports champions employ a world-class talent development process, I invite you to make them a source for adapting liberating models, mind-expanding beliefs, and novel best principles. And learning from a Super Bowl-winning coach is a great place to start this journey."

"Books to read","Stephen King"," Lisey’s Story A novel unlike any other in the King catalogue. It is a terrifying leap of imagination for King — the story concerns the widow of a famous writer. And yes, there’s some otherworldly stuff that goes on here, but the book is most concerned with the secret language that develops in any long relationship. Full of memories and flashback and internal dialogue and exhortations shouted out to empty rooms, this is one book that’ll never be made into a crappy movie.  Dans Macabre An early eighties nonfiction work in which King dissects the many forms of scary books and movies. A dense read, it is nonetheless catnip for anyone who has ever cared a whit about horror.  The Dead Zone This book about a man cursed with the ability to see the future is many things — a psychic chiller, a serial-killer novel, a political thriller — but what lingers the most is the main character, Johnny Smith. There is a sense of melancholy around him that cannot be found elsewhere in the King universe. "

"Books to read","10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works by Dan Harris","started with five minutes a day, and very quickly noticed three benefits: 1. Increased focus, 2. A greater sense of calm, and 3. A vastly improved ability to jolt myself out of rumination and fantasies about the past or the future, and back to whatever was happening right in front of my face.\n\nOver time (I’ve now been at it for about four years and do 35 minutes a day), an even more substantial benefit kicked in: I created a different relationship to the voice in my head. You know the voice I’m talking about. It’s what has us reaching into the fridge when we’re not hungry, pruning our inboxes when we’re ostensibly in conversation with other human beings, and losing our temper only to regret it later. The ability to see what’s going on in your head at any given moment without reacting to it blindly – often called “mindfulness” – is a superpower."

"Books to read","После трудно начать новые","10 книг, после которых трудно начать читать новые!\n\n1. Халед Хоссейни — ""Бегущий за ветром""\n\nОшеломляющий дебютный роман, который уже называют главным романом нового века, а его автора - живым классиком. ""Бегущий за ветром"" - проникновенная, пробирающая до самого нутра история о дружбе и верности, о предательстве и искуплении. Нежный, тонкий, ироничный и по-хорошему сентиментальный, роман Халеда Хоссейни напоминает живописное полотно, которое можно разглядывать бесконечно. \n\n2. Элис Сиболд — ""Милые кости""\n\n""Шестого декабря тысяча девятьсот семьдесят третьего года, когда меня убили, мне было четырнадцать лет"" - так начинается самый поразительный бестселлер начала XXI века, трагическая история, написанная на невероятно светлой ноте. ""Милые кости"" переведены на сорок языков, разошлись многомиллионным тиражом и послужат основой для следующего, после ""Властелина колец"" и ""Кинг-Конга"", кинопроекта Питера Джексона. В этом романе Сюзи Сэлмон приспосабливается к жизни на небесах и наблюдает сверху, как ее убийца пытается замести следы, а семья - свыкнуться с утратой...\n\n3. Нил Гейман — ""Никогде""\n\nПод улицами Лондона существует мир, о котором большинство людей и не подозревает. В нем слово становится настоящей силой. Туда можно попасть, только открыв Дверь. Этот мир полон опасностей, населен святыми и монстрами, убийцами и ангелами...\n\n4. Сьюзен Коллинз — ""Сойка-пересмешница""\n\nКитнисс выжила, хотя дом ее разрушен. Ее семья - в относительной безопасности. Но... Пит похищен власть имущими, и судьба его не известна. И тогда легенда становится реальностью. Таинственный Тринадцатый дистрикт выходит из тени, в которой скрывался долгие годы. Начинается война. Война за справедливость? Война за лучшее будущее? Возможно. Китнисс в этой войне - символ сопротивления. И если она не хочет оказаться пешкой в чужой большой игре, если не хочет, чтобы жизнь ее любимого принесли в жертву чужим интересам, ей придется стать сильной. Сильнее, чем на арене Голодных игр...\n\n5. Владимир Набоков — ""Лолита""\n\nВ 1955 году увидела свет ""Лолита"" - третий американский роман Владимира Набокова, создателя ""Защиты Лужина"", ""Отчаяния"", ""Приглашения на казнь"" и ""Дара"". Вызвав скандал по обе стороны океана, эта книга вознесла автора на вершину литературного Олимпа и стала одним из самых известных и, без сомнения, самых великих произведений ХХ века. Сегодня, когда полемические страсти вокруг ""Лолиты"" уже давно улеглись, можно уверенно сказать, что это - книга о великой любви, преодолевшей болезнь, смерть и время, любви, разомкнутой в бесконечность, ""любви с первого взгляда, с последнего взгляда, с извечного взгляда"". \n\n6. Патрик Зюскинд — ""Парфюмер. История одного убийцы""\n\nТриллер-бестселлер, описывающий историю жизни блестящего парфюмера и кровавого убийцы Жан-Батиста Гренуя, мгновенно стал мировой сенсацией. Общий тираж романа составил более 15 миллионов экземпляров, он переведен на 42 языка, среди которых есть даже латынь!\nСпустя 21 год после выхода романа в свет он продолжает будоражить своих читателей; его изучают студенты университетов по всему миру, причем студенты различных факультетов и специальностей: психологи, историки, криминалисты, юристы и, конечно же, филологи. Совсем недавно роман появился в списках ""наиболее читаемых произведений"", опубликованных журналами ""Oprah"" и ""InStyle"". ""Парфюмер"" признан самым знаменитым романом, написанный на немецком языке, со времен книги Э.М.Ремарка ""На западном фронте без перемен"".\n\n7. Сомерсет Моэм — ""Бремя страстей человеческих""\n\nВозможно, самый значительный роман Сомерсета Моэма. Гениальность, с которой писатель раскрывает темные и светлые стороны человеческой души, проявилась тут особенно отчетливо.\nИ именно в этой книге Моэм с удивительной даже для него искренностью обнажает душу собственную...\n\n8. Харуки Мураками — ""Норвежский лес""\n\n...По вечерам я продавал пластинки. А в промежутках рассеянно наблюдал за публикой, проходившей перед витриной. Семьи, парочки, пьяные, якудзы, оживленные девицы в мини-юбках, парни с битницкими бородками, хостессы из баров и другие непонятные люди. Стоило поставить рок, как у магазина собрались хиппи и бездельники - некоторые пританцовывали, кто-то нюхал растворитель, кто-то просто сидел на асфальте. Я вообще перестал понимать, что к чему. ""Что же это такое? - думал я. - Что все они хотят этим сказать?""...\n\n9. Виктор Пелевин — ""Числа""\n\nГлавный герой романа - бизнесмен Степа, лучший друг которого - число 34, а злейший враг - число 43... Степа помнил, что когда он был совсем маленьким, цвета были у всех цифр. Потом они стерлись, только у четверки остался хорошо различимый зеленый, у семерки – синий, и у тройки – слабые следы оранжевой краски на центральном выступе.\n\n10. Леонид Андреев — ""Рассказ о семи повешенных""\n\nПроза Леонида Андреева причудливо переплетает трепетную эмоциональность, дотошный интерес к повседневности русской жизни и, зачастую, иррациональный страх перед кошмарами «железного века». \nГлавная тема произведения Андреева «Рассказ о семи повешенных» - любовь и смерть, жестокосердие и духовная стойкость человека. Повести и рассказы этого писателя стали одними из высших достижений русской литературы начала XX века.\n\n#книги@yakor.blog"

"Books to read","“$100 Startup” - Chris Guillebeau","This book is about people who have started successful businesses - earning at least $50,000 a year - without spending more than $100 to get started. It profiles people living unconventionally, following their dreams, and building things for themselves. Most of the businesses in the book have remained small intentionally, as the owners value their lifestyle over traditionally ideas of careers and success. Guillebeau himself is unconventional. He blogs at The Art of Non-Conformity, where he documented his recently-completed quest to visit every country in the world - without breaking the bank (he shows you how to do it). Even if you’re not interested in entrepreneurship, this book will inspire you to live your life on your own terms."
"Books to read","“One Man’s Meat” - E.B. White","This is my favorite book of all time. E. B. White is more known for his children’s books like “Charlotte’s Web” and “Stuart Little”. But his non-fiction is even better. “One Man’s Meat” is a collection of essays White wrote while living on a farm in Maine in the 1940s. He grew up in New York, so he’s not really a country man, but he’s not really a city man either. He’s just a man, and comes across as one you’d very much like to spend time with. The writing is beautiful - I read it when I’m stuck with my own writing and need to see how it’s supposed to be done. The book is about how he lived his normal life - even with the sense of approaching war - and won’t inspire you to do anything specific. But it will inspire you to be content with your life and not take yourself too seriously, and just carry on and be happy."
"Books to read","""A Paradise Built in Hell"" - Rebecca Solnit","In this interesting take on tragedy, Solnit examines the human reaction to 5 different disasters throughout the 20th and 21st centuries - the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the 1917 Halifax harbor explosion, the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York, and the 2005 New Orleans hurricane. Contrary to the popular depiction of chaos and selfishness shown in movies and TV shows, Solnit uses a vast number of historical sources to show how much people actually bond together to help those in need. This book showed me the positive aspects of human nature that rise to the surface during emergencies, which I experienced firsthand during the recent floods in southern Alberta."
"Books to read","“Mastery” - Robert Greene","Greene profiles history’s greatest achievers and doers of things and details what made them so successful. His profiles include Charles Darwin, Mozart, Henry Ford, Buckminster Fuller, and many others. He convincingly dispels the myth that their success was due to some innate genius unreachable by regular people. Greene finds commonalities in each of their rises to success and presents a formula anyone can follow to achieve similar success."
"Books to read","“4 Hour Chef” - Tim Ferriss","Where Gladwell’s success requires 10,000 hours, Ferriss’s takes 4. He’s been criticized for his approach. Critics claim he offers shortcuts or the easy way out. But that’s not actually what he does. His “4 Hour” series isn’t meant to be taken literally. Ferriss’s approach preaches accelerated learning by showing more efficient and unconventional ways of doing things. For learning languages, for example, he recommends learning the most commonly used words first. Because something like 20% of the words in a language make up 80% of communication. “The 4 Hour Chef” is a cookbook about cooking, but it’s also about how to become proficient in almost anything in a short amount of time."

Without a thought or a word, she let go.\n\nShe let go of the fear.\n\nShe let go of the judgments.\n\nShe let go of the confluence of opinions swarming around her head.\n\nShe let go of the committee of indecision within her.\n\nShe let go of all the ‘right’ reasons.\n\nWholly and completely, without hesitation or worry, she just let go.\n\nShe didn’t ask anyone for advice.\n\nShe didn’t read a book on how to let go.\n\nShe didn’t search the scriptures.\n\nShe just let go.\n\nShe let go of all of the memories that held her back.\n\nShe let go of all of the anxiety that kept her from moving forward.\n\nShe let go of the planning and all of the calculations about how to do it just right.\n\nShe didn’t promise to let go.\n\nShe didn’t journal about it.\n\nShe didn’t write the projected date in her Day-Timer.\n\nShe made no public announcement and put no ad in the paper.\n\nShe didn’t check the weather report or read her daily horoscope.\n\nShe just let go.\n\nShe didn’t analyze whether she should let go.\n\nShe didn’t call her friends to discuss the matter.\n\nShe didn’t do a five-step Spiritual Mind Treatment.\n\nShe didn’t call the prayer line.\n\nShe didn’t utter one word.\n\nShe just let go.\n\nNo one was around when it happened.\n\nThere was no applause or congratulations.\n\nNo one thanked her or praised her.\n\nNo one noticed a thing.\n\nLike a leaf falling from a tree, she just let go.\n\nThere was no effort.\n\nThere was no struggle.\n\nIt wasn’t good and it wasn’t bad.\n\nIt was what it was, and it is just that.\n\nIn the space of letting go, she let it all be.\n\nA small smile came over her face.\n\nA light breeze blew through her. And the sun and the moon shone forevermore…\n\n~ Rev. Safire Rose\n\n \n"

A new person coming to CAA, what are their motivations? Are they curious, in that curious young college kid mode? Are they lonely freshmen looking for community? Are they seeking some sort of righteous status? Do they identify with the animals being abused, were they a rape or molestation victim? Are they seeking a career path? The faster motivations are answered, the easier it is to read if someone will complete a task or not.\n\nI find that people completing tasks for me are more often than not doing them because I am their friend and aspire to identify and ""be with"" me, part of ""a community"". I give encouragement, they follow through, feel some sense of accomplishment and then they disappear because I do not have further projects or offer them financial compensation. So how quick can you get a stranger to identify with you and the quickest way is by taking he prerogative and identifying with them.\n\n\nAnyways you got me thinking as to how far my own immigrant heritage ties into my animal rights beliefs and it seems here that there is some common identification. Reminds of Upton Sinclair's book anti-meat industry book ""The Jungle"". It had a big impact because the worker's were immigrants and the working conditions were grotesque and came into American consciousness early in its experience with the industrial revolution. Not necessarily because of the obvious wrongs being committed against animals.\n\nYour experience in India and ""coming of age"" would make a great zine. I don't know if you've thought about writing about it but it would be something to consider."

The article isn't really related. It just got me to thinking about the different ways morality seems to work in people's lives.\n1. Should we just accept (and expect) that the movement will be fractured? I'm thinking of other institutions (e.g., religions) and movements and they're _all_ fractured at some level. Is it reasonable to expect humans in the animal rights movement to operate differently? Probably not.\n2. Just like social opinion tends to lead the law, do our feelings mostly lead our reasons and morality? I think there's a lot said on this already. Do you know if Nick Cooney's book talks about it? I might prioritize reading it if so. I'm believing more strongly these days that extra-rational influences figure centrally in determining our morality.

"Books to read","Flourish by Martin seligman","In today's selection — from Flourish by Martin E. P. Seligman. A generation ago, the study of psychology was dominated by a focus on the abnormal and the negative. But more recently, there have been academic movements that have undertaken a data and research-based study of the positive dimensions of psychology, with a view toward prescribing activities that can be imbedded into a person's life and increase that person's structural level of happiness. One such effort comes from Martin Seligman and the University of Pennsylvania. The following is a sample of the type of activity this academic school of thoughts recommends based on its own systematic studies to deal with the increasing prevalence of depression in our society: \n\n""Here's a brief exercise that will raise your well-being and lower your depression: The gratitude visit. Close your eyes. Call up the face of someone still alive who years ago did something or said something that changed your life for the better. Someone who you never properly thanked; someone you could meet face-to-face next week. Got a face? Gratitude can make your life happier and more satisfying. When we feel gratitude, we benefit from the pleasant memory of a positive event in our life. Also, when we express our gratitude to others, we strengthen our relationship with them. But sometimes our thank you is said so casually or quickly that it is nearly meaningless. … Your task is to write a letter of gratitude to this individual and deliver it in person. The letter should be concrete and about three hundred words: be specific about what she did for you and how it affected your life. Let her know what you are doing now, and mention how you often remember what she did. Make it sing! Once you have written the testimonial, call the person and tell her you'd like to visit [him or] her, but be vague about the purpose of the meeting; this exercise is much more fun when it is a surprise. When you meet her, take your time reading your letter. \n\n""You will be happier and less depressed one month from now. …\n\n""Here's a second exercise to give you the flavor of the interventions that we have validated in random-assignment, placebo-controlled designs: [The] What-Went-Well Exercise (Also Called 'Three Blessings') We think too much about what goes wrong and not enough about what goes right in our lives. Of course, sometimes it makes sense to analyze bad events so that we can learn from them and avoid them in the future. However, people tend to spend more time thinking about what is bad in life than is helpful. Worse, this focus on negative events sets us up for anxiety and depression. One way to keep this from happening is to get better at thinking about and savoring what went well. \n\n""For sound evolutionary reasons, most of us are not nearly as good at dwelling on good events as we are at analyzing bad events. Those of our ancestors who spent a lot of time basking in the sunshine of good events, when they should have been preparing for disaster, did not survive the Ice Age. So to overcome our brains' natural catastrophic bent, we need to work on and practice this skill of thinking about what went well. \n\n""Every night for the next week, set aside ten minutes before you go to sleep. Write down three things that went well today and why they went well. You may use a journal or your computer to write about the events, but it is important that you have a physical record of what you wrote. The three things need not be earthshaking in importance ('My husband picked up my favorite ice cream for dessert on the way home from work today'), but they can be important ('My sister just gave birth to a healthy baby boy'). \n\n""Next to each positive event, answer the question 'Why did this happen?' For example, if you wrote that your husband picked up ice cream, write 'because my husband is really thoughtful sometimes' or 'because I remembered to call him from work and remind him to stop by the grocery store.' Or if you wrote, 'My sister just gave birth to a healthy baby boy,' you might pick as the cause 'God was looking out for her' or 'She did everything right during her pregnancy.' \n\n""Writing about why the positive events in your life happened may seem awkward at first, but please stick with it for one week. It will get easier. The odds are that you will be less depressed, happier, and addicted to this exercise six months from now. \n\n\nFlourish: A Visionary New Understanding of Happiness and Well-being\nAuthor: Martin E.

But as she “was becoming disturbingly pretty,” Alphonsine soon realized she had another option: being “kept” by a man of means. The first such prospect presented himself in the form of a middle-aged, middle-class widower who offered her a furnished apartment, rented in her own name, and 3,000 francs up front for her “initial needs.” However degrading this proposal may have been, Kavanagh writes, the alternative was “even less appealing,” for Alphonsine most likely earned no more than 22 francs a month working six-day weeks, 13 hours a day, as a shop girl — “a punishing routine in which it was all too easy to become trapped for decades.” In fact, according to Kavanagh, “in Alphonsine’s mind, there was no alternative.” And while one might question the certainty with which a biographer purports to know the workings of her subject’s mind (especially when the subject has left behind no diaries and very few letters to document those workings), the outcome of Marie’s musings was incontrovertible. Weighing disreputable comfort against respectable hardship, Alphonsine chose comfort. A femme entretenue was born."

Джулия Кэмерон, знаменитая в богемных кругах США как выдающийся консультант по раскрытию творческих способностей человека, считает, что креативность - одно из фундаментальных качеств человеческой природы, настоящий духовный путь самореализации и выхода за рамки привычного восприятия жизни. \nЭта книга - практический курс, рассчитанный на 12 недель ежедневных занятий, помогающих начинающему (продвинутому) творцу (любому из нас) разглядеть и разбудить в себе новые, подчас неожиданные таланты."

Ту гонку он проиграл, но от своих слов не отступился. В итоге он 12 раз стал победителем Ironman, в том числе дважды на Гавайях.\n\nВ чем секрет его побед, только ли в природных способностях и необычайном трудолюбии? Нет. У него особая мотивация (он поставил себе цель собрать огромную сумму на борьбу с раком, от которого умерла его мать). У него есть определенная система тренировок, часть которой изложена в книге. У него есть группа поддержки. Он анализирует возможности и настрой главных соперников и строит тактику исходя из этого, удивительным образом сплетая сотрудничество и соперничество с ними.\n\nПуть побед Криса не был гладким, но перечисленные факторы позволили ему дойти до вершин. Нельзя сказать, что так может каждый. Но то, что руководствуясь принципами Криса, можно улучшить свои результаты, вряд ли можно подвергать сомнению."

"Books to read","Charles Bukowski Rails Against 9-to-5 Jobs in a Brutally Honest Letter (1986)"," \nAndreas Clerk shared with you:\n \n\nCharles Bukowski Rails Against 9-to-5 Jobs in a Brutally Honest Letter (1986)\nOpen Culture - Charles Bukowski—or “Hank” to his friends—assiduously cultivated a literary persona as a perennial drunken deadbeat. He mostly lived it too, but for a few odd jobs and a period of time, just over a decade, that he spent working for the United States Post Office, beginning in the early fifties as a fill-in letter carrier, then later for over a decade as a filing clerk. He found the work mind-numbing, soul-crushing, and any number of other adjectives one uses to describe repetitive and deeply unfulfilling labor. Actually, one needn’t supply a description—Bukowski has splendidly done so for us, both in his fiction and in the epistle below unearthed by Letters of Note.\n\n\nAvailable on the App Store.\n\n\n\nVerstuurd vanaf mijn iPad"

Once he was digging in the sand when he saw a beautiful woman sunning herself on a blanket. Her skin glistened. Pasquale couldn't stop staring. When she finally packed up her blanket and left, she waved at him, but Young Presquile was far too mesmerized to wave back. Then he saw something fall from her bag. He ran over and picked it up from the sand. It was a ring, set with some kind of reddish stone. Pasquale held it in his hand for a moment as the woman walked away. Then he looked up to see that his mother was watching him, waiting to see what he would do. ""Signora!"" he called after the woman, and chased her down the beach. The woman stopped, took the ring back, thanked him, patted him on the head, and gave him a 50-lira coin. When he returned, Pascuales mother said, ""I hope that is what you would have done even if I wasn't watching you."" Pass squally wasn't sure what she meant. ""Sometimes, ""she said, ""what we want to do and what we must do are not the same. "" she put a hand on his shoulder. ""Pasqo, the smaller the space between your desire and what is right, the happier you will be. ""\nAnd while his mother's lecture had gone over his seven-year-old head, Pasquale saw now what she meant-how much easier life would be if our intentions and our desires could always be aligned."

"Books to read","Banville, John: Ancient Light","Is there any difference between memory and invention? That is the question that fuels this stunning novel, written with the depth of character, the clarifying lyricism and the sly humor that have marked all of John Banville’s extraordinary works. And it is the question that haunts Alexander Cleave, an actor in the twilight of his career and of his life, as he plumbs the memories of his first—and perhaps only—love (he, fifteen years old, the woman more than twice his age, the mother of his best friend; the situation impossible, thrilling, devouring and finally devastating) . . . and of his daughter, lost to a kind of madness of mind and heart that Cleave can only fail to understand. When his dormant acting career is suddenly, inexplicably revived with a movie role portraying a man who may not be who he says he is, his young leading lady—famous and fragile—unwittingly gives him the opportunity to see with aching clarity the “chasm that yawns between the doing of a thing and the recollection of what was done.”"
"Books to read","Abbott, Megan: Queenpin","A young woman hired to keep the books at a down-at-the-heels nightclub is taken under the wing of the infamous Gloria Denton, a mob luminary who reigned during the Golden Era of Bugsy Siegel and Lucky Luciano. Notoriously cunning and ruthless, Gloria shows her eager young protégée the ropes, ushering her into a glittering demimonde of late-night casinos, racetracks, betting parlors, inside heists, and big, big money. Suddenly, the world is at her feet—as long as she doesn't take any chances, like falling for the wrong guy. As the roulette wheel turns, both mentor and protégée scramble to stay one step ahead of their bosses and each other."
"Books to read","Ross, Adam, Ladies and Gentlemen (ss)","A hotshot lawyer, burdened by years of guilt and resentment, comes to the rescue of his irresponsible, irresistible younger brother. An unsettling story resonates between the dysfunctional couple telling it and their listening friends as well. A lonely professor, frequently regaled with unbelievably entertaining tales by the office handyman, suddenly fears he’s being asked to abet a murderous fugitive. An awkward but nervy adolescent uses his brief career as a child actor to further his designs on a WASPy friend’s seemingly untouchable sister. A man down on his luck closes in on a mysterious, much-needed job offer while doing a good turn for his fragile neighbor, with results at once surreal and hilarious. And when two college kids goad each other on in an escalating series of breathtaking dares, the outcome is as tragic as it is ambiguous."
"Books to read","Omarsdottir, Kristin: Children in Reindeer Woods","Eleven-year-old Billie lives at a 'temporary home for children¿ called Children in Reindeer Woods, which she discovers one afternoon, to her surprise, is in the middle of a war zone. When a small group of paratroopers kill everyone who lives there with her, and then turn on each other, Billie is forced to learn to live with the violent, innocent, and troubled Rafael, who decides to abandon the soldier¿s life and become a farmer, no matter what it takes"
"Books to read","Klaussmann, Liza: Tigers in Red Weather","Nick and her cousin, Helena, have grown up sharing sultry summer heat, sunbleached boat docks, and midnight gin parties on Martha's Vineyard in a glorious old family estate known as Tiger House. In the days following the end of the Second World War, the world seems to offer itself up, and the two women are on the cusp of their 'real lives': Helena is off to Hollywood and a new marriage, while Nick is heading for a reunion with her own young husband, Hughes, about to return from the war. \n\nSoon the gilt begins to crack. Helena's husband is not the man he seemed to be, and Hughes has returned from the war distant, his inner light curtained over. On the brink of the 1960s, back at Tiger House, Nick and Helena--with their children, Daisy and Ed--try to recapture that sense of possibility. But when Daisy and Ed discover the victim of a brutal murder, the intrusion of violence causes everything to unravel. The members of the family spin out of their prescribed orbits, secrets come to light, and nothing about their lives will ever be the same."
"Books to read","Holt, Jim: Why Does the World Exist? (nf)","Tackling the “darkest question in all of philosophy” with “raffish erudition” (Dwight Garner, New York Times), author Jim Holt explores the greatest metaphysical mystery of all: why is there something rather than nothing? This runaway bestseller, which has captured the imagination of critics and the public alike, traces our latest efforts to grasp the origins of the universe. Holt adopts the role of cosmological detective, traveling the globe to interview a host of celebrated scientists, philosophers, and writers, “testing the contentions of one against the theories of the other” (Jeremy Bernstein, Wall Street Journal). As he interrogates his list of ontological culprits, the brilliant yet slyly humorous Holt contends that we might have been too narrow in limiting our suspects to God versus the Big Bang. This “deft and consuming” (David Ulin, Los Angeles Times) narrative humanizes the profound questions of meaning and existence it confronts.\nShow more \nShow less"
"Books to read","Ackroyd, Peter: Foundation: The History of England from Its Earliest Beginnings to the Tudors (nf)","In Foundation, the chronicler of London and of its river, the Thames, takes us from the primeval forests of England’s prehistory to the death, in 1509, of the first Tudor king, Henry VII. He guides us from the building of Stonehenge to the founding of the two great glories of medieval England: common law and the cathedrals. He shows us glimpses of the country’s most distant past—and Neolithic stirrup found in a grave, a Roman fort, a Saxon tomb, a medieval manor house—and describes in rich prose the successive waves of invaders who made England English, despite being themselves Roman, Viking, Saxon, or Norman French."

For other uses, see Art of War (disambiguation).\n\nPeter Whitehorne's 1573 translation of the Art of War\n\nArt of War (Italian: Dell'arte della guerra) is a treatise by the Italian Renaissance political philosopher and historian Niccolò Machiavelli.\nThe format of Art of War is a socratic dialogue. The purpose, declared by Lord Fabrizio Colonna (perhaps Machiavelli's persona) at the outset, ""To honor and reward virtù, not to have contempt for poverty, to esteem the modes and orders of military discipline, to constrain citizens to love one another, to live without factions, to esteem less the private than the public good."" To these ends, Machiavelli notes in his preface, the military is like the roof of a palazzo protecting the contents.\nWritten between 1519 and 1520 and published the following year, it was the only historical or political work printed during Machiavelli's lifetime, though he was appointed official historian of Florence in 1520 and entrusted with minor civil duties.\n\nConte... \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War_(Machiavelli)"

"Books to read","Bill gates' tips","1. Business Adventures, by John Brooks\n""Warren Buffett recommended this book to me back in 1991, and it's still the best business book I've ever read. Even though Brooks wrote more than four decades ago, he offers sharp insights into timeless fundamentals of business, like the challenge of building a large organization, hiring people with the right skills, and listening to customers' feedback,"" writes Gates.\n\n2. The Bully Pulpit, by Doris Kearns Goodwin\nAn historian, Kearns Goodwin examines the presidencies of Theodore Roosevelt and William Taft in this book. Why would an entrepreneur not particularly interested in early-20th century U.S. presidents respond to it? The tenure of these leaders is used to explore fascinating questions, Gates explains. ""I'm especially interested in the central question that Goodwin raises: How does social change happen? Can it be driven solely by an inspirational leader, or do other factors have to lay the groundwork first?""\n\n3. On Immunity, by Eula Biss\nWith the recent measles outbreak in the U.S. making headlines, this pick by Gates seems particularly timely. ""The eloquent essayist Eula Biss uses the tools of literary analysis, philosophy, and science to examine the speedy, inaccurate rumors about childhood vaccines that have proliferated among well-meaning American parents,"" Gates writes, recommending the book particularly for new parents.\n\n4. Making the Modern World, by Vaclav Smil\nGates calls historian Smil ""probably his favorite living author,"" whose every work is a must-read thanks to his clear vision and nuanced thinking. In this book, writes Gates, ""Smil examines the materials we use to meet the demands of modern life, like cement, iron, aluminum, plastic, and paper. The book is full of staggering statistics.""\n\n5. How Asia Works, by Joe Studwell\nWhy add this one to your personal reading list? ""Business journalist Joe Studwell produces compelling answers to two of the greatest questions in development economics: How did countries like Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and China achieve sustained, high growth? And why have so few other countries managed to do so?"" Gates enthuses.\n\n6. How to Lie With Statistics, by Darrell Huff\nData is all the rage, but getting the most out of it requires numerical savvy and clear thinking. This oldie but goodie (published in 1954) can help you separate insightful uses of data from numbers that are all smoke and mirrors. According to Gates, the topic is ""more relevant than ever. One chapter shows you how visuals can be used to exaggerate trends and give distorted comparisons. It's a timely reminder, given how often infographics show up in your Facebook and Twitter feeds these days."""

"Books to read","25 Books for Success, the Rest of the List","The Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives\n Dan Millman\n (HJ Kramer, 2006)\n The first of Dan Millman's writings, this book is an inspirational story based largely on his college years. The book delves into the notion that a person can be accomplished and successful without feeling alive or genuinely happy.\n\nMillman learns ""the way of the peaceful warrior"" from a mysterious old man he names Socrates. His mentor leads him through a journey of self-discovery. The lessons the young man endures and later accepts are applicable for anyone searching for greater meaning in life.\n\nLaws of Success\n Napoleon Hill\n (Combined Registry Co., 1966)\n Twenty-six years of research, including interviews with more than 500 self-made millionaires, laid the foundation for this massive collection. After studying the methods and accomplishments of masterminds such as Thomas Edison, John D. Rockefeller, Henry Ford, Andrew Carnegie, Theodore Roosevelt and Alexander Graham Bell, Napoleon Hill compiled what he learned, offering it to the world as the Laws of Success.\n\nMore than theories for a book, Hill applied the precepts to his life and discovered immeasurable success. The book's size might seem intimidating, but Hill wrote so it could be taught to high school students, keeping the text rich but easy to understand. This personal-development guru paves the road to success with timeless wisdom.\n\nAcres of Diamonds\n Russell H. Conwell\n (Filiquarian, 2007)\n Opportunities for success, wealth and happiness often lie under foot and yet go unnoticed. This little book, originally a speech by Russell Conwell, serves as a reminder not to overlook the abundance right on our doorstep.\n\nThis timeless work is freely available online, in both written and audio formats, and addresses the myth that fame and fortune are waiting somewhere ""out there."" He also dispels the notion that men and women of integrity shouldn't desire money or wealth. ""Money is power, and you ought to be reasonably ambitious to have it. You ought because you can do more good with it than you could without it,"" Conwell said. And to that end, he advises readers to begin searching for the diamonds in their lives… at home.\n\nAs a Man Thinketh\n James Allen\n (Filiquarian, 2007)\n Published in 1902, ""This little volume"" as James Allen refers to it, has been a source of inspiration for millions and has influenced the work of many respected personal-development leaders. And with statements such as, ""The soul attracts that which it secretly harbors, that which it loves, and also that which it fears,"" Allen paved the way for many contemporary philosophers.\n\nAt its core is the belief that ""as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he."" Allen uses eloquent period language to bring readers to the realization that thoughts and character are inseparably intertwined. Equally as important is the lesson of personal responsibility taking precedence over thoughts and actions. He prescribes focused time to reflect and discover yourself and your dreams, and to put forth energy and time to make those dreams reality. This book, now in the public domain and freely accessible on the Internet, should be in every achiever's library.\n\nMaximum Achievement\n Brian Tracy\n (Simon & Schuster, 1995)\n As suggested by this book's subtitle, ""Strategies and skills that will unlock your hidden powers to succeed,"" it's likely you already possess what's required to create success in your life. Those who apply these strategies provided by Brian Tracy can make changes that quickly produce results.\n\nLearn how to create success that encompasses every area of life-health, personal and professional happiness, relationships and wealth. Whether you're already on the road to success or just getting started on your success journey, the principles outlined in the book will help you realize your true potential. Build the life you want and attain the peace of mind that comes with the knowledge that you control your destiny.\n\nThe Seasons of Life\n Jim Rohn & Ronald Reynolds\n (Jim Rohn International, 1981)\n In The Seasons of Life, Jim Rohn and Ronald Reynolds draw parallels between life and the changing seasons. When you learn that change is the only guarantee, you can make the most of each season as it comes into your life.\n\nIt's possible to learn and grow from every experience. The authors help readers understand that every season is necessary and valuable-even winter, when life seems harsh and your actions unfruitful.\n\nSee You at the Top\n Zig Ziglar\n (Pelican Publishing Company, 2000)\n There's room for you at the top! Zig Ziglar's message has inspired millions to change their lives by helping them do, be and have more than they dared dream possible.\n\nZiglar offers a nuts-and-bolts approach to developing the self-image, attitudes and habits that make people successful. Learn how to set and achieve goals, how to create momentum that propels you forward in life and why being focused on others is a critical aspect of success. This step-by-step guide will help you excel in every area of life.\n\nThe Magic of Thinking Big\n David J. Schwartz\n (Pocket Books, 1995)\n Thinking big separates the achievers from the average. In this best-selling classic, David Schwartz suggests that it's not necessarily intelligence or work ethic that move people up the ladder of success, but the personal choice people make to believe that something bigger and better is possible.\n\nMake time to reflect on your life's goals and expand them. Once you have a clear picture of what you want, focus your energy on achieving that goal. Keep your eyes fixed on your goal and do not allow the small thinking of the world around you to cloud your vision. Schwartz offers practical advice for putting the magic of thinking big to work in your life.\n\nThe Power of Positive Thinking\n Norman Vincent Peale\n (Fireside, 2007)\n The belief that positive thoughts lead to a positive reality isn't a new phenomenon. Decades before The Secret, Norman Vincent Peale wrote The Power of Positive Thinking. The book teaches readers that focused, intentional and unyielding belief is required before they can achieve the lives they desire.\n\nThe philosophies from this best-selling book have helped millions reach their personal, financial, spiritual and relationship goals. Learn to replace negative thoughts with positive beliefs and to break the worry habit by cultivating a character that isn't swayed by circumstances.\n\nAwaken the Giant Within\n Anthony Robbins\n (Free Press, 1992)\n Within each person is a sleeping giant of greatness. With this book, motivational coach Anthony Robbins seeks to help you ""take immediate control of mental, emotional, physical and financial destiny.""\n\nNot one to do things in a small way, Robbins found huge success, lost it all and then, using the techniques outlined in this book, took control of his life and his success. This personal-development classic delves into the specifics of goal-setting, achieving success in relationships, talking to yourself and discovering your true potential.\n\nDeveloping the Leader Within You\n John C. Maxwell\n (Thomas Nelson, 2005)\n Developing the Leader Within You makes the theories of leadership personal. For those struggling to take the next step in their careers or who doubt their leadership abilities, the book offers practical methods for developing leadership skills.\n\nRecognizing that some people have innate leadership-personality traits, the book provides direction for becoming more effective. But John Maxwell's book debunks the myth that only an exclusive few are born to be leaders. Instead, he suggests that everyone benefits from learning self-discipline, seeking mentors and adding to their skills through training.\n\nMaxwell defines leadership as influence and points out that a management title isn't a prerequisite. Regardless of your career, position or personality, learn how to become an effective leader.\n\nThe One Minute Manager\n Kenneth Blanchard\n (HarperCollins Business, 2000)\n Apply the principals taught in The One Minute Manager and watch your team's productivity and job satisfaction grow. This allegorical tale pulls together the wisdom gained through experience, allowing readers to prosper without making their predecessors' mistakes.\n\nThe One Minute management style allows leaders to be efficient and effective with their time. The short chapters in this easy read focus on interaction between managers and their teams. By setting goals that encourage, redirecting, reprimanding and praising appropriately, leaders can get more from their teams while earning their respect.\n\nGood to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't\n Jim Collins\n (Collins, 2001)\n If good is the enemy of great, can good companies become great? And if so, how is that transition made with lasting effect? These are some of the questions central to the research that led to the publication of Good to Great.\n\nFive years of investigation uncovered the characteristics that made uncommonly great companies outshine their competition and earn significantly higher profits. Comparing the differentiating traits of good companies and their great counterparts, Jim Collins and his research team learned that, among other things, leaders who willingly work with their heads and hearts, rather than their egos, are required to take a company from good to great. Such leaders create the foundation for the culture and sustainable results that propel an organization to excellence.\n\nThe Automatic Millionaire\n David Bach\n (Broadway, 2003)\n Who wouldn't want to become a millionaire automatically? The truths related in this book, as in Bach's Finish Rich series, are that nothing great is accomplished without forethought. But with a little planning and by putting many aspects of your finances on autopilot, you can be on the road to wealth.\n\nThe automatic aspect plan allows readers to save time while saving money. And though many of the principles aren't new, Bach's easy-to-u"

Here’s some of the stuff that appeared as exam set texts in Chinese class, or that we were expected to have read:\n\n1. The Four Great Classical Novels (on the if-you-haven’t-read-them-you’re-not-Chinese reading list)\n- Water Margin (水滸傳)\n- Romance of the Three Kingdoms (三國演義)\n- Journey to the West (西遊記)\n- Dream of the Red Chamber (紅樓夢)\n\n2. Poems and text excerpts in Classical Chinese\n- Zuiweng Tingji (醉翁亭記) by Ouyang Xiu\n- Chu Shi Biao (出師表) by Zhuge Liang\n- Bring In The Wine (將進酒) by Li Bai and Song of the Wagons (兵車行) by Du Fu\n- poems by Su Shi, Li Qingzhao etc.\n- Excerpts from Confucius’s Analects, Zhuangzhi and Mencius\n\n3. Modern Chinese lit (some appeared as exam texts; I only had to write reports for longer novels)\n- Family, Spring, Autumn Trilogy (家春秋) by Ba Jin\n- Taipei People (臺北人), Death in Chicago (芝加哥之死), Ashes (骨灰), Lonely Seventeen (寂寞的十七歲) by Pai Hsien-yung\n- poems, e.g. Farewell Again, Cambridge (再別康橋) by Xu Zhimo\n- Song of Everlasting Sorrow (長恨歌) by Wang Anyi\n- anything by Eileen Chang\n\nLastly, martial arts novels (wuxia) are considered too lowbrow for schools to teach but they’re completely addictive and I highly recommend them, especially anything by Jin Yong. Some of his best works are The Condor Trilogy, Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils, The Deer and the Cauldron. (99% of kids I knew have read all his books - he’s the most popular wuxia writer by far.)\nposted by monocot at 0:35 on July 23, 2013 [9 favorites +] [!] "

"Books to read","The Genius in Every Child: Encouraging Character, Curiosity, and Creativity in Children","Genius is not just about intelligence and aptitude, it's also a word that embodies our inner soul, nature, or character. In this illuminating book, a former principal and father shares heartwarming stories and wise advice that offers a rare insight into children and the process of education. The Genius in Every Child celebrates the moments in the lives of children, their parents, and their teachers. The stories of unique characters in action illustrate some of the principles of education and the disciplines we need to be good stewards of our children’s character and intellect. The vignettes provide both delight and enjoyment in the miracle of it all, and perspective and solace in the difficulty of it all, encouraging parents and teachers to work hand-in-hand.\n \nThis book urges parents to focus on the long run, entrusting the trials, struggles, and sufferings of the short run to the kids. It proposes a shift in focus from test scores to enthusiasm, from perfect behavior to learning from mistakes, from measuring up to making something of yourself, from independence to interdependence, from goodness to integrity, from fear to love. The value of this experience to hundreds of children, parents, and teachers derives from the depth of Rick Ackerly’s perception and the subtlety of his understanding. He offers perspective and guidance on a wide range of challenges faced by parents of today’s school-aged children, including: self-confidence, discipline, boundary-setting, building character, integrity, taking responsibility, facing challenges, handling disappointment, peer pressure, reading, testing, homework, academic achievement, failure, and success.\n[Excerpt]\nMr. Rick's Words of Wisdom\nChildren need teachers at school and parents at home.\nFailure is at least as powerful an educator as success.\nKids need consequences and they need forgiveness \nWe put our kids at risk by trying to engineer their success.\nOur children need us to have confidence in them.\nThe core of building character is taking responsibility.\nIf we are open to the surprise, we can let them educate us."
"Books to read","Псих романы","9 лучших психологических романов мира\n\n1. Олдос Хаксли ""Контрапункт""\nИзысканный, злой и безупречно точный роман нравов, восходящий к творчеству даже не Уайльда, но - Теккерея. Роман, автор которого как хирургическим скальпелем препарирует быт и нравы английского высшего света эпохи ""прекрасных двадцатых"". Роман, исполненный юмора и сарказма, однако поднимающийся порой до уровня высокой трагедии.\nПеред вами - ""поиски утраченного времени"" по Олдосу Хаксли, времени всеобщего увлечения фрейдизмом и авангардизмом, времени неустанных духовных поисков, блестящих побед и горьких поражений...\n\n2. Николас Борн ""Фальшивка""\nРоман Николаса Борна ""Фальшивка"" стал культовой книгой и интеллектуальным бестселлером для нескольких поколений читателей. В 1981 году роман был экранизирован Фолькером Шлендорфом.\n\nНа войне как на войне... Нам ли не знать. Так происходит сейчас. Так было тридцать лет назад: Ближний Восток, разрывы бомб, журналист, пытающийся понять суть происходящего кошмара. Хотя только ли кошмара? Ведь за углом этого ада есть мирный квартал, есть женщина, которую можно любить под вой пролетающих снарядов... Что в этой войне и в этой любви правда, а что - фальшь? Каким ""информационным мифотворчеством"" занимается Георг Лашен, отправляя свои репортажи в одну из немецких газет? ""Мысль изреченная есть ложь""? А чувства... А сама жизнь... Неужели и они - фальшивка?\n\n3. Михаил Лермонтов ""Герой нашего времени""\nРоман ""Герой нашего времени"" - одна из вершин русской прозы первой половины XIX в. Воспринятый современниками М.Ю.Лермонтова как ""странный"", роман побуждает все новые и новые поколения читателей искать решения его загадкам.\n\n4. Джон Фаулз ""Волхв""\n""Волхв"" Джона Фаулза - психологическая драма, мистический детектив с элементами эротики, парадоксальный роман, интеллектуальная загадка...\nНа греческом островке проводятся психологические опыты, связанные со страхами и эмоциями людей и превращающие их жизнь в пытку.\nИгра начинается.\n\n5. Харуки Мураками ""Кафка на пляже""\nЯ заметил, что на груди белой майки налипло что-то черное, по форме - вроде большой бабочки с раскрытыми крыльями… В мерцающем свете люминесцентной лампы стало понятно: это темно-красное кровавое пятно. Кровь свежая, еще не засохла. Довольно много. Я наклонил голову и понюхал пятно. Никакого запаха. Брызги крови - совсем немного - оказались и на темно-синей рубашке, где она была не так заметна. А на белой майке - такая яркая, свежая…Кошмарное странствие по лабиринтам души - в новом романе Харуки Мураками ""Кафка на пляже"".\n\n6. Иэн Бэнкс ""Мост""\nВ романе известного шотландского писателя Иэна Бэнкса «Мост» (The Bridge) тесно переплетены три пласта повествования. Это история человека, потерявшего память, которому не может помочь психоаналитик; рассказ о варваре, колдуне и сказочной стране; описание бурной личной жизни инженера-энергетика из Эдинбурга. До конца неизвестно, что их объединяет, кроме Моста, в пролетах которого живут все эти люди. Непонятно и кто из них, на самом деле, спит.\n\n7. Юрий Трифонов ""Дом на набережной""\n""Дом на набережной"" - одно из самых острых и злободневных произведений XX века. В повести дан глубочайший анализ природы страха, деградации людей под гнетом тоталитарной системы.\nНеподдельный интерес к человеку, стремление показать его в самые драматические события его жизни и поворотные моменты истории ставят повесть Юрия Трифонова в ряд лучших произведений мировой литературы.\n\n8. Майкл Каннингем ""Избранные дни""\nРоман «Избранные дни» – повествование удивительной силы. Оригинальный и смелый писатель, Каннингем соединяет в книге три разножанровые части: мистическую историю из эпохи промышленной революции, триллер о современном терроризме и новеллу о постапокалиптическом будущем, которые связаны местом действия (Нью-Йорк), неизменной группой персонажей (мужчина, женщина, мальчик) и пророческой фигурой американского поэта Уолта Уитмена.\n\n9. Уильям Голдинг ""Шпиль""\nРоман ""Шпиль"" Уильяма Голдинга является, по мнению многих критиков, кульминацией его творчества как с точки зрения идейного содержания, так и художественного творчества. В этом романе, действие которого происходит в английском городе XIV века, реальность и миф переплетаются еще сильнее, чем в ""Повелителе мух"". В ""Шпиле"" Голдинг, лауреат Нобелевской премии, еще при жизни признанный классиком английской литературы, вновь обращается к сущности человеческой природы и проблеме зла."
"Books to read","Книги для прочтения перед тем как уволиться и начать свой бизнес","Мышление и вдохновение\n\n1. «Разбуди в себе исполина» — Тони Роббинс (Awaken The Giant Within — Tony Robbins)\n\nВоодушевляющая книга Тони Роббинса. Сложно изложить в виде одного урока, который я смогла вынести, однако в целом у этой книги есть потенциал изменить вашу жизнь.\n\n2. «Выбросы: история успеха» — Малкольм Гладуэлл (Outliers — Malcolm Gladwell)\n\nДает понимание реальных историй успеха и рассказывает о том, как люди преуспели. Малкольм Гладуэлл представляет идею овладения любым навыком за 10 000 часов. Мне особенно понравились истории, как упорный труд и удача (происхождение, место рождения или даже дата рождения) могут иметь равное значение для достижения успеха.\n\n3. «Переломный момент» — Малкольм Гладуэлл (The Tipping Point — Malcolm Gladwell)\n\nМалкольм Гладуэлл исследует тот самый волшебный «переломный момент», которого достигает тренд или идея, когда они распространяются подобно пожару.\n\n4. The Millionaire Fastlane — MJ DeMarco (нет издания на русском)\n\nЧтобы разбогатеть — станьте производителем, а не потребителем, и перестаньте продавать свое время за деньги. Эта книга хорошо сочетается с концептом книги «Богатый папа, Бедный папа» (приводится ниже в разделе «Финансы»).\n\n5. «От хорошего к великому» — Джим Коллинз (Good to Great — Jim Collins)\n\nПятилетнее исследование на тему того, что отличает хорошие компании от великих компаний. Это отличная книга о составлении долгосрочных планов для вашей компании, в противопоставление краткосрочным поправкам.\n\nПродуктивность\n\n6. «Четырехчасовая рабочая неделя» — Тим Феррис (The Four Hour Work Week — Tim Ferris)\n\nЗарабатывать больше, работая меньше — совершенно чуждый концепт, особенно учитывая то, что я пришла из архитектурной сферы, где нам часто приходилось работать сверх тех часов, за которые нам платили. Еще я поняла силу аутсорсинга. Только одно это уже неизмеримо повысило мою продуктивность. Я рекомендую эту книгу каждому — предприниматель вы или нет.\n\n7. «Совокупный результат» — Даррен Харди (The Compound Effect — Darren Hardy)\n\nЯ использую формулу, которую вынесла из данной книги, чтобы стать лучшей версией себя. Книга является базовым мануалом, как стать успешным и жить неординарной жизнью.\n\n8. «Принцип 80/20» — Ричард Кох (The 80/20 Principles — Richard Koch)\n\nСосредоточиться на критических задачах, которые требуют только 20% усилий и приносят 80% результата. Очень мощный концепт, и я нахожу его весьма правильным в моем бизнесе. Я воспользовалась им в Calm the Ham, чтобы определить своих ключевых клиентов — те 20%, которые приносят мне 80% дохода. И затем я спросила себя: как я могу обеспечить лучший сервис этим людям?\n\n9. «Совершенная машина продаж» — Чет Холмс (The Ultimate Sales Machine — Chet Holmes)\n\nПерестать делать 4 тысячи разных дел в моем бизнесе. Согласно его «упертой дисциплине и распределению» я вместо этого должна уметь идеально выполнять 8 задач 4000 раз.	Глава, посвященная тайм-менеджменту, в книге «Совершенная машина продаж» оказалась крайне полезной, так как у меня с этим были проблемы. Воспользовавшись советом Чета Холмса, я сделала для себя отличный органайзер, чтобы распланировать все согласно критичности моих задач. Позже он эволюционировал в SELF Journal.\n\n10. «Сила привычки» — Чарльз Дахигг (The Power of Habit — Charles Duhigg)\n\nИзучив природу формирования привычки, я научилась избавляться от своих плохих привычек. Также в книге приводятся замечательные истории о том, как корпорации использовали привычки, чтобы продавать свой продукт (моя любимая — история о зубной пасте).\n\nБизнес\n\n11. «Сам себе MBA» — Джош Кауфман (The Personal MBA — Josh Kaufman)\n\nОтличный обзор всего, что мне необходимо было знать (и более того) о бизнесе, без всякой ерунды и умных слов.\n\n12. «Экономичный стартап» — Эрик Райс (The Lean Startup — Eric Reis)\n\nРаспределяйте ресурсы настолько экономично, насколько это возможно, чтобы ваш бизнес был готов к быстрому реагированию. Замечательная книга о том, как найти наилучшее применение ограниченным ресурсам.\n\n13. «Стартап за 100 долларов» — Крис Гильбо (The $100 Startup — Chris Guillebeau)\n\nВдохновляет на создание стартапа. Вам не нужны большие деньги для того, чтобы начать жизнь полную приключений и возможностей. Доказательство: Я запустила Calm The Ham менее чем за $500.\n\n14. «Увлечение — это бизнес» — Гари Вайнерчук (Crush it — Gary Vaynerchuk)\n\nГари Вайнерчук написал эту замечательную книгу о том, как превратить вашу страсть и увлечения в настоящий бизнес. Он объяснил, как он использует свои пристрастия, социальные медиа и прозрачность в своем бизнесе, чтобы сокрушить конкурентов.\n\n15. «Предпринимательский миф» — Майкл Гербер (The E-Myth Revisited — Michael E. Gerber)\n\nГрамотно распределять дела, чтобы я могла работать над своим бизнесом, а не над делами. Это дало мне свободу увеличивать доход и оставлять больше свободного времени для себя.\n\n16. «Фиолетовая корова» — Сет Годин (Purple Cow — Seth Godin)\n\nКлюч к успеху — это быть значимой среди моих конкурентов и выделяться в условиях сегодняшней экономики.\n\n17. «ReWork: бизнес без предрассудков» — Джейсон Фрайд и Дэвид Хейнмейер Ханссон (ReWork — Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson)\n\nКороткая, но впечатляющая книга от создателей 37 Signals. Оставайтесь маленькими, работайте в условиях ограниченных ресурсов и стройте меньше.\n\n18. This Book Will Teach You How To Write Better — Neville Medhora (нет издания на русском)\n\nКраткое пособие от Невилла Медоры из Appsumo дает отличное представление о копирайтинге, помогает научиться лучше писать, превращать людей в своих клиентов, и раскрывает некоторые секреты, как писать проще.\n\nПродажи\n\n19. «Человеку свойственно продавать» — Дэниел Пинк (To Sell is Human — Daniel Pink)\n\n«Продажи» — это не бранное слово. Эта книга помогла мне почувствовать себя комфортно в среде торговли. Она отлично подходит для понимания концепций, скрывающихся за словом «продажи», и объясняет, как их постичь.\n\n20. «Идеальный питч» — Орен Клафф (Pitch Anything — Oren Klaf)\n\nЗамечательное объяснение того, как структурировать продающие звонки или презентации, чтобы убедиться, что предполагаемый клиент на них клюнет. Происходит из среды, отличной от торговли, я нахожу это особенно интересным.\n\nФинансы\n\n21. «Богатый папа, Бедный папа» — Роберт Кийосаки (Rich Dad, Poor Dad — Robert T. Kiyosaki)\n\nЭта книга по-настоящему раскрывает концепцию богатства, активов и пассивов. Я помню, как ехала в метро и думала: «Почему я не прочитала эту книгу 10 лет назад?» Лучше поздно, чем никогда.\n\n22. I Will Teach You To Be Rich — Ramit Sethi (нет издания на русском)\n\nЛичные финансы — это не обязательно скучно. Я принесла в свою жизнь тактику ведения переговоров и экономии из этой книги, что помогло мне как зарабатывать, так и экономить деньги."

"Books to read","Various historical","Cromwell is the subject of Hilary Mantel's Booker Prize winning novels, Wolf Hall (2009) and Bring Up the Bodies (2012), which explore his humanity and to some extent rebuts the unflattering portrait in A Man for All Seasons. Wolf Hall won the 2009 Man Booker Prize. Mantel's second novel of a planned trilogy about Cromwell and Henry VIII, Bring Up the Bodies, was published in May 2012. It quickly made the New York Times Best Seller List.[40] and, like its predecessor, was awarded the Man Booker Prize.\nCromwell is a leading character in the first two Matthew Shardlake historical crime fiction novels by C. J. Sansom, Dissolution and Dark Fire.\nHe is a major character in The Trusted Servant by Alison Macleod, whose main protagonist begins as Cromwell's younger protégé.\nHe is given minor roles in two of Philippa Gregory's novels, The Other Boleyn Girl (2001) and The Boleyn Inheritance.\nHe is one of the major characters in H. F. M. Prescott's novel The Man on a Donkey, which depicts a power struggle between Cromwell and Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy, representing the old nobility.\nHe is arguably the dominant character in Ford Madox Ford's novel The Fifth Queen (1906–1908), which presents a vivid portrait of his intelligence and intimidating personality."

"Books to read","Adam Grant Suggestions","The New Books to Read This Fall\nMy favorite part of being an author is writing. A close second is finding new books in my mailbox. This fall, there’s an unusually exciting crop of big idea and business books about human behavior, innovation and entrepreneurship, and the fundamental questions of success, meaning, and happiness in work and life. Here are the 14 forthcoming and just-released books to check out:\n\n1. Me, Myself, and Us by Brian Little (October 14)\n\nI’ve never read a book that revealed so much about my own personality, let alone the peculiar habits of my friends, coworkers, and family members. With extraordinary wit and wisdom, Little— the winner of Canada’s highest award for university teaching and one of Harvard’s favorite professors—offers startling insights about our trivial pursuits and magnificent obsessions.\n\n2. Rookie Smarts by Liz Wiseman (October 14)\n\nIf you believe in the value of experience, prepare to have your worldview turned upside-down. Wiseman masterfully shows why novices can outdo veterans, expertise blinds us to fresh ideas, and we’re all missing out on the brilliance of the newbies around us.\n\n3. The Innovators by Walter Isaacson (October 7)\n\nThe author who brought us the epic biographies of Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, and Benjamin Franklin is back. It’s the saga of Silicon Valley as we’ve never seen it before: a behind-the-scenes journey with the pioneers who invented the computer, the Internet, and the digital revolution.\n\n4. Crazy is a Compliment by Linda Rottenberg (October 7)\n\nRottenberg offers a treasure trove of ideas to jumpstart new entrepreneurs and accelerate the success of startups. She has guided many of the world’s greatest entrepreneurs, and this book is full of tips for fueling innovation in companies, nonprofits, governments, and schools.\n\n5. The Upside of Your Dark Side by Todd Kashdan and Robert Biswas-Diener (September 25)\n\nAt long last, here’s a book on why happiness can make us sad, mindfulness might be overrated, and discomfort sets the stage for comfort. This pair of psychologists offers a provocative, evidence-based case for a balanced life. If you don’t read it, you should feel guilty—and it turns out that will be good for you.\n\n6. A Path Appears by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn (September 23)\n\nIn their fourth book together, this Pulitzer Prize-winning married couple examines how regular people make a difference. From preventing disease and fixing education, to evaluating global aid and local charity, to fighting violence, the combination of inspiring examples, cutting-edge science, and practical recommendations is going to change how we think about changing the world.\n\n7. How Google Works by Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg (September 23)\n\nHow did Google grow from a disruptive search engine into the world’s most valuable company? Two leaders share lessons from the inside out on strategy, decision-making, innovation, and culture.\n\n8. Zero to One by Peter Thiel (September 16)\n\nThiel argues that the secret to progress is not competition, but monopoly. Drawing on his experience as cofounder of PayPal and Palantir, and an early investor in companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Yelp, he offers fascinating ideas about how to shift from copying something old to creating something new.\n\n9. Hello, My Name is Awesome by Alexandra Watkins (September 15)\n\nHow do you find the right name for your brand or your company? This is what Watkins does for a living—her company is responsible for renaming a wedding brunch service Bloody Married and a frozen yogurt franchise Spoon Me—and her clever examples and advice will spare us all from putting the wrong foot forward.\n\n10. The Small Big by Robert Cialdini, Noah Goldstein, and Steve Martin (September 9)\n\nIf you’ve ever struggled to change the beliefs or behaviors of other people, there’s hope. The world’s leading experts on persuasion offer the best of science and practical insights about influence.\n\n11. Smartcuts by Shane Snow (September 9)\n\nThis book solves a major mystery, illuminating how visionaries and pioneers find faster ways to achieve their goals. With spellbinding stories and relevant research, Snow has delivered one of the most entertaining and thought-provoking books of the year.\n\n12. Excellent Sheep by William Deresiewicz (August 19)\n\nAccording to this former Yale professor, elite colleges aren’t teaching students how to think. Deresiewiczproposes to reinvent higher education so that students develop strong values and find meaningful definitions of success.\n\n13. Powers of Two by Joshua Wolf Shenk (August 5)\n\nWe think bold new ideas come from individuals and teams, but the heart of creativity lies in dynamic duos. Shenk examines the chemistry behind the imaginative pairs who spawned the Beatles, Apple, South Park, and the civil rights movement. Learn about the surprising benefits of conflict and power imbalances—and how to find the right partner and build trust.\n\n14. Building a Better Teacher by Elizabeth Green (August 4)\n\nGreat education is the foundation of a flourishing society, and it depends on great teachers. Green, a leading education journalist, offers strong evidence and compelling cases to illuminate what it takes to get children to pay attention, sharpen their reasoning, and contribute to insightful discussions.\n\nAnd if you’re still searching for more, here are the other new releases that I’m looking forward to reading:\n•Pioneering the Possible by Scilla Elworthy (October 7)\n•How to Kill a Unicorn by Mark Payne (October 7)\n•Being Mortal by Atul Gawande (October 7)\n•Not That Kind of Girl by Lena Dunham (September 30)\n•This Changes Everything by Naomi Klein (September 16)\n•Innovating Women by Vivek Wadhwa and Farai Chideya (September 9)\n•Dataclysm by Christian Rudder (September 9)\n•Mind Gym by Sebastian Bailey and Octavius Black (September 9)\n•The Impulse Society by Paul Roberts (September 2)\n\n***\n\nAdam is a Wharton professor and the New York Times bestselling author of Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success.

Verne's 1-page strategic plan is now used by both companies I've founded, and thousands of other companies. And our management teams use much of the methodology from this book. What's great is that it's both inspirational and quite practical - an excellent read for any entrepreneur or manager at a small business."

"Books to read","Book shops","\nlarge image\n\n\nIt's easy to buy books online these days but nothing is quite like visiting a bricks and mortar bookshop and browsing the rows of shiny new, or fascinating old books. Brisbane has quite a few cool independent bookshops, some specialising in preloved books, others in specific genres. There is Pulp Fiction on Edward Street, which carries mysteries, science fiction, fantasy, horror and art books. Rosemary's Romance, as the name suggests, specialises in all types of romance: historical, erotica, humour, manga, you name it! \n\n\n Then there is Archives on Charlotte Street, with it's wonderful smelling secondhand collection and Avid Reader in West End with its great selection and in-store events where you can meet authors and hear them do readings.\n\nPlease share your favourite haunts below.\n"

Just know that the actions of my past, and the past before my past that ended up being partly my present at that time even though it's the past that has now improved your current present in some good way. I'm only about 20%sure that made some sense....so bear with me!\n\n  Well, like I mentioned my name is Peter. But, everyone calls me PJ. Except my dad, Dr.William Chantz who isn't a nickname type of guy. As well as my mom, Susan Chantz, who calls me Petey instead. My fathers occupation is scientist/inventor. You might've heard stories about some of his inventions- The Past Frogger, The Past Freezer, The Past Breaker, The Past Mender. Obviously they weren't very creative with their names. And when I say ""they"", I also mean Dr. John Tennial. Who also happens to be my best friend, Samuel Daniel Tennial's, father. I've gathered that Dr.T likes his names to match in someway or form. "

"Books to read","Abaddon’s Gate, by James S.A. Corey","Abstractly, I care nothing for space opera. But I read the first book in the Expanse series (Leviathan Wakes) on a trip and found myself swiftly addicted to the story. The second book, Caliban’s War, was even better. This is the third book and it continues the horror-tinged space opera epic with all its magnificence intact. It’s a little slower to build than the second book, but once it kicks into gear — sweet motherless goatfucker, it gets cray-cray.\n\nIn other news, James S.A. Corey is like, fifteen people or something. Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck I know for sure. But I also think there’s like, some kind of alien hive-mind at work here, and maybe a talking llama, and definitely a supercomputer housed in an ancient glacier."
"Books to read","Twelve-Fingered Boy, by John Hornor Jacobs","A very serious candidate for favorite book of the year. I fucking devoured this YA sorta-kinda-coming-of-age novel about a pair of psychic boys in an Arkansas correctional institution. It’s dark and twisted and funny and violent and the writing is downright powerful and the characters are grip-your-throat compelling. It’s a little bit horror novel, it’s a little bit X-Men, it’s a whole lotta Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn. I’ve liked JHJ’s earlier novels quite a bit, but this one really buried its hooks in me. Bonus: already read the second in the series, The Shibboleth, which takes the small seed of mythology in the first book and grows a whole goddamn tree out of it, turning up the volume on the X-Men / Chronicle vibe. Go find the first book now, now, now."

"Books to read","Apocalypse Now Now, by Charlie Human ","I can’t explain this book using words. I can only use my mouth to mumble and mutter while my eyes grow larger and larger. I blurbed this and, quite seriously, that was basically my blurb: “NO IDEA WHAT THE FUCK TO SAY.” It’s like, if you took Zoo City and made Neil Gaiman rewrite it but first you made him read Naked Lunch and eat a lot of hallucinogenic drugs? Cape Town supernatural weirdness. There. That’s all I got. I don’t think this has a US deal yet?"
"Books to read","Vicious, by V. E. Schwab","Here’s generally how it works if you ask me to blurb a book: I will take the book and make it very clear, “I probably don’t have time to read this,” which is true, but also a way for me to insulate you against the reality that I may not dig the book, or I might just forget because I have a brain like a hamster-nibbled cracker. The books I inevitably do blurb often get blurbed because of one reason: because I pick it up on a lark and idly read the first couple pages.\n\nOr, that’s what I think will happen\n\nWhat really happens is suddenly I look up from the book and I’ve wolfed down like, 50-100 pages.\n\nAnd I blink and go, “Whoa-dang,” and then I devour the rest like pie at Thanksgiving.\n\nBooks like that get blurbed because I fall into them. Because any and all of my critical response levels are shut-down and dazzled by the powerful prestidigitation and misdirection of a damn good story. And that’s this book. A supervillain book as much as it is a superhero book. A book about bad people and nemeses and redemption. Crackling writing and pinpoint plotting. Needs its own comic book, TV show, breakfast cereal. Doubly upsetting is that Schwab isn’t even 30 years old yet GODDAMN IT who let her in the club was it you?"

"Books to read","The Shining Girls, by Lauren Beukes ","The second very serious candidate for favorite book of the year. I think Zoo City is an amazing achievement and deserves its very own pedestal — but Beukes really ratcheted things up with The Shining Girls. (How to sell it in brief: “A survivor of a time-traveling serial killer’s attack attempts to understand what happened to her and soon finds herself hunting the hunter.”Rich and layered, creepy and poetic. Full of complex and compelling characters — many (most) of them “shining” women who the serial kill wants to rob of their spark. Contains one of the most brutal, cringe-worthy scenes I’ve ever read. (Like, in a good way. I still get the shivers thinking about it. LAUREN BEUKES IS ONE OF OUR MOST BAD-ASS DANGEROUS WRITERS. Read her.)"
"Books to read","NOS4A2, by Joe Hill ","It’s a book big enough to bludgeon a bull elk, and that’s a damn good thing because it’s one of those books you never want to end (and also, you might get attacked by a bull elk and trust me when I say, those guys are assholes). I’m guilty as a writer of encouraging folks to get to the story, to step on the accelerator and move this motherfucker along — and certainly Hill knows how to do that, because with a book like Heart-Shaped Box he took what I woulda thought would’ve been the whole novel and collapsed that part into the first 30 pages, which gave that particular book a surprising amount or urgency and surprise. But NOS4A2, which offers up a young girl’s lifelong battle against a vampiric wretch bound to a candy-cane hellscape known as Christmasland, is an epic horror story that takes a lot of time to grow compelling characters before plunging you into the dark and icy waters. (In fact, it is the protagonist’s struggle against herself that is as fascinating as her battle against the monster, Charlie Manx. Powerful writing, inescapable horror, grave dread punctuated by the small-town life made famous by the novels of Hill’s own father. (In fact, this book has some loose tie-ins to the Dark Tower mythology, if that tweaks your nipples.) Great, great book. One of those books where I wish I was a time-traveling serial killer, actually, so I could go back in time, murder Joe Hill, and claim this book as my own."

"Books to read","In the garden of beasts by Erik Larson","The time is 1933, the place, Berlin, when William E. Dodd becomes America’s first ambassador to Hitler’s Nazi Germany in a year that proved to be a turning point in history.\n    A mild-mannered professor from Chicago, Dodd brings along his wife, son, and flamboyant daughter, Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and pomp, and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored of the “New Germany,” she has one affair after another, including with the suprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. But as evidence of Jewish persecution mounts, confirmed by chilling first-person testimony, her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked, the press is censored, and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen, the Dodds experience days full of excitement, intrigue, romance—and ultimately, horror, when a climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitler’s true character and ruthless ambition.\n    Suffused with the tense atmosphere of the period, and with unforgettable portraits of the bizarre Göring and the expectedly charming--yet wholly sinister--Goebbels, In the Garden of Beasts lends a stunning, eyewitness perspective on events as they unfold in real time, revealing an era of surprising nuance and complexity. The result is a dazzling, addictively readable work that speaks volumes about why the world did not recognize the grave threat posed by Hitler until Berlin, and Europe, were awash in blood and terror."

With this novel about a young 19th-century Philadelphia woman who becomes a world-renowned botanist, Gilbert shows herself to be a writer at the height of her powers. Surprisingly, it turns out moss is a riveting subject. (Yes, it’s 512 pages, but the botany-based story is so engrossing you’ll be done by Saturday—not Sunday.)\n\nRead more: http://www.oprah.com/book/The-Signature-of-All-Things?editors_pick_id=46876#ixzz2llue9BpC"

Taken under the wing of the hospital’s most notable patient, Zelda Fitzgerald, Evalina witnesses the cascading events leading up to the tragic fire of 1948 that killed nine women in a locked ward, Zelda among them.\n\nAuthor Lee Smith has created, through her artful blending of fiction and fact, a mesmerizing novel about a world apart--a time and a place where creativity and passion, theory and medicine, tragedy and transformation, are luminously intertwined. "
"Books to read","Vanished by Wil S Hylton","In the fall of 1944, a massive American bomber carrying eleven men vanished over the Pacific islands of Palau, leaving a trail of mysteries. According to mission reports from the Army Air Forces, the plane crashed in shallow water—but when investigators went to find it, the wreckage wasn't there. Witnesses saw the crew parachute to safety, yet the airmen were never seen again. Some of their relatives whispered that they had returned to the United States in secret and lived in hiding. But they never explained why.\n\nFor sixty years, the U.S. government, the children of the missing airmen, and a maverick team of scientists and scuba divers searched the islands for clues. They trolled the water with side-scan sonar, conducted grid searches on the seafloor, crawled through thickets of mangrove and poison trees, and flew over the islands in small planes to shoot infrared photography. With every clue they found, the mystery only deepened.\n\nNow, in a spellbinding narrative, Wil S. Hylton weaves together the true story of the missing men, their final mission, the families they left behind, and the real reason their disappearance remained shrouded in secrecy for so long. This is a story of love, loss, sacrifice, and faith—\nof the undying hope among the families of the missing, and the relentless determination of scientists, explorers, archaeologists, and deep-sea divers to solve one of the enduring mysteries of World War II."
"Books to read","The Maid's Version by Daniel Woidrell","\nAlma DeGeer Dunahew, the mother of three young boys, works as the maid for a prominent citizen and his family in West Table, Missouri. Her husband is mostly absent, and, in 1929, her scandalous, beloved younger sister is one of the 42 killed in an explosion at the local dance hall. Who is to blame? Mobsters from St. Louis? The embittered local gypsies? The preacher who railed against the loose morals of the waltzing couples? Or could it have been a colossal accident? Alma thinks she knows the answer-and that its roots lie in a dangerous love affair. Her dogged pursuit of justice makes her an outcast and causes a long-standing rift with her own son. By telling her story to her grandson, she finally gains some solace-and peace for her sister. He is advised to ""Tell it. Go on and tell it""-tell the story of his family's struggles, suspicions, secrets, and triumphs"

"Books to read","Интел бестселлер","10 лучших интеллектуальных бестселлеров!\n\n1. Дж. М. Кутзее — ""В ожидании варваров""\n\nСамый загадочный писатель из всех нобелевских лауреатов, посвятивший нобелевскую речь не кому-нибудь, а Робинзону Крузо, человек, само имя которого долго оставалось загадкой. Небольшой городок на окраине безымянной Империи взбудоражен известием о скором нападении племен варваров из приграничных пустынь. Прибывший из сердца Империи полковник, готовый извести всякого, лишь бы выбить из человека нужные показания. Городской судья, не желающий поддаваться панике и в результате из обвинителя превратившийся в обвиняемого. Пленная девушка, которая для судьи становится объектом чувственно-религиозного поклонения. Роман-притча, роман-метафора, напоминающий безумные фантазии Кафки, Беккета и Буццати. Настоящее удовольствие для читателей интеллектуальных бестселлеров.\n\n2. Маркус Зузак — ""Книжный вор""\n\nЯнварь 1939 года. Германия. Страна, затаившая дыхание. Никогда еще у смерти не было столько работы. А будет еще больше.\nМать везет девятилетнюю Лизель Мемингер и ее младшего брата к приемным родителям под Мюнхен, потому что их отца больше нет — его унесло дыханием чужого и странного слова «коммунист», и в глазах матери девочка видит страх перед такой же судьбой. В дороге смерть навещает мальчика и впервые замечает Лизель.\nТак девочка оказывается на Химмельштрассе — Небесной улице. Кто бы ни придумал это название, у него имелось здоровое чувство юмора. Не то чтобы там была сущая преисподняя. Нет. Но и никак не рай.\n\n3. Кадзуо Исигуро — ""Остаток дня""\n\nУрожденный японец, выпускник литературного курса Малькольма Брэдбери, написавший самый английский роман конца XX века!\nДворецкий Стивене, без страха и упрека служивший лорду Дарлингтону, рассказывает о том, как у него развивалось чувство долга и умение ставить нужных людей на нужное место, демонстрируя поистине самурайскую замкнутость в рамках своего кодекса служения.\nВ 1989 г. за «Остаток дня» Исигуро единогласно получил Букера {и это было, пожалуй, единственное решение Букеровского комитета за всю историю премии, ни у кого не вызвавшее протеста). Одноименная экранизация Джеймса Айвори с Энтони Хопкинсом в главной роли пользовалась большим успехом. А Борис Акунин написал своего рода ремейк «Остатка дня» — роман «Коронация».\n\n4. Иэн Макьюэн — ""На берегу""\n\nИэн Макьюэн—один из «правящего триумвирата» современной британской прозы (наряду с Джулианом Барнсом и Мартином Эмисом), лауреат Букеровской премии за роман «Амстердам». Его новейшая книга, предлагаемая вашему вниманию, также вошла в прошлом году в Букеровский шорт-лист. Это, по выражению критика, «пронзительная, при всей своей камерности, история об упущенных возможностях в эпоху до сексуальной революции». Основные события романа происходят между Эдуардом Мэйхью и Флоренс Понтинг в их свадебную ночь, и объединяет молодоженов разве что одинаковая неискушенность: оба вспоминают свою прошлую жизнь и боятся будущего.\n\n5. Джон Краули — ""Эгипет""\n\nПочему считается, что цыгане умеют предсказывать будущее? Почему на долларовой банкноте изображены пирамида и светящийся глаз? Почему статуя Моисея работы Микеланджело имеет рожки на голове? Потому что современной эпохе предшествовал Эгипет; не Египет, но - Эгипет. Потому что прежде всего было не так, как нынче, а властвовали другие законы, а скоро все снова переменится, и забытые боги опять воцарятся в душах и на небесах. Потому что нью-йоркские академические интриги и зигзаги кокаинового дилерства приводят скромного историка Пирса Моффета в американскую глушь, тогда как Джордано Бруно отправляется в странствие длиною в жизнь, а Джон Ди и Эдвард Келли видят ангелов в магическом кристалле. Обо всем этом - в романе ""Эгипет"" несравненного Джона Краули; первом романе тетралогии, которая так и называется - ""Эгипет"".\n\n6. Рэй Бредбери — ""Вино из одуванчиков""\n\nВойдите в светлый мир двенадцатилетнего мальчика и проживите с ним одно лето, наполненное событиями радостными и печальными, загадочными и тревожными; лето, когда каждый день совершаются удивительные открытия, главное из которых - ты живой, ты дышишь, ты чувствуешь! ""Вино из одуванчиков"" Рэя Брэдбери - классическое произведение, вошедшее в золотой фонд мировой литературы.\n\n7. Иэн Бэнкс — ""Осиная фабрика""\n\nЗнаменитый роман выдающегося шотландца, самый скандальный дебют в английской прозе последних десятилетий. Познакомьтесь с шестнадцатилетним Фрэнком. Он убил троих. Он - совсем не тот, кем кажется. Он - совсем не тот, кем себя считает. Добро пожаловать на остров, который стерегут Жертвенные Столбы. В дом, где на чердаке ждет смертоносная Осиная Фабрика.\n\n8. Брет Истон Эллис — ""Правила секса""\n\nВ престижном колледже Кэмден веселятся до упада и пьют за пятерых. Здесь новичку не дадут ни на минуту расслабиться экстравагантные вечеринки и экстремальные приколы, которым, кажется, нет конца. Влюбляясь и изменяя друг другу, ссорясь и сводя счеты с жизнью, местная богема спешит досконально изучить все запретные страсти и пороки, помня основной закон: здесь не зря проведет время лишь тот, кто усвоит непростые правила бесшабашного секса... \n\n9. Дэвид Митчелл — ""Литературный призрак""\n\nВпервые на русском - дебютный роман прозванного ""английским Мураками"" автора таких поразительных бестселлеров, как ""Сон № 9"" и ""Облачный атлас"". Но именно ""Литературный призрак"" с его фирменной митчелловской полифоничностью в мгновение ока вознес молодого автора на британский литературный олимп. На этих страницах переплелись жизненные пути молодого сектанта, по указке Его Провидчества устроившего зариновую атаку в токийском метро, и начинающего саксофониста, который подрабатывает в магазинчике коллекционного винила, банковского менеджера из Лондона, отмывающего в Гонконге деньги русской мафии, и ветерана английской разведки, решившего опубликовать свои воспоминания, его ""литературного негра"" (по совместительству - лидера панк-группы) и витающего над монгольскими степями бесплотного призрака, женщины-физика с ирландского островка, за которой охотится Пентагон, похитителей эрмитажных картин, нью-йоркского диджея и многих-многих других....\n\n10. Дорис Лессинг — ""Пятый ребенок""\n\nГарриет и Дэвиду с самого начала удается осуществить прекрасную мечту всех молодоженов: у них есть большой и уютный дом, стабильный доход, четверо счастливых и прелестных ребятишек и куча любящих родственников. Каникулы в их доме - изобильные праздники жизни и семейного счастья. А потом у них появляется пятый ребенок, ничего сверхъестественного... Но вот человек ли он?\n\n#книги@yakor.blog"

Most importantly, the Day was when 13 Icons fell from the heavens and landed in the most populous cities on  the earth, effectively wiping out nearly a billion people. The Day was when the war was lost with no hope to fight back.\nDol was just a baby when the Icons landed and wiped out her family, but beyond that painful memory, she remembers nothing else but a life in the Grasslands. The grasslands are a safe haven od sorts on the outskirts of the Silent City with no electricity, no watchful eye of the Icon and most importantly, little to no intrusion by the Embassy to the Lords. Dol's closest friend, Ro, is also in the Grasslands, and together they have a unique bond. On the inside of Dol's wrist is one small gray dot while on the inside of Ro's wrists are two red dots, the color of fire. These dots mark their destiny as ones born with unique emotional powers that set them apart from regular humans.\ndol gets interested in Lucas, the boy with four dots who can channel Love and make people wrk against their will.  But he's the son of the ambassador of the Lords, and the ambassador wants to keep peace.\nbut they will fight back."

They're actually closer than sisters, they're clones. Hiding from a govmt agency that would expose them, the Best family appears to consist of a single mother with one daughter named Elisabeth. Lizzie, Ella and Betsey take turns going to school, attending social engagements, and a group mindset has always been a de fecto part of life..\n\nThen Lizzie meets Sean Kelly, a guy who seems to see into her very soul.  As their relationship develops, Lizzie realizes that she's not a carbon copy of her sisters; she's an individual with unique dreams and desires, and digging deeper into her background, Lizzie begins to dismantle the delicate balance of an unusual family that only science could have created."

"Books to read","Chronicles of Narnia","In What Order Should the Narnia Books Be Read?\nBy Andrew Rilstone\n\nThe internecine strife between Lewis aficionados about the order of the Narnia books shows no signs of abating. In principle, both devout Chronologists and sincere Publicationists both allow that people should read the books in whatever order they chose. Yet both groups, in their hearts, believe that their order is best. Fisticuffs can easily develop, and the first excommunications and crusades cannot be far away. In an attempt to resolve this very serious issue, I offer my own, definitive, take on the problem.\n\n1: Chronology vs Publication\nC.S Lewis’s famous series of children’s stories were published between 1950 and 1956, in the following order:\n\n1. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950)\n2. Prince Caspian(1951)\n3. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (1952)\n4. The Silver Chair (1953)\n5. The Horse and His Boy (1954)\n6. The Magicians Nephew(1955)\n7. The Last Battle (1956)\n\nAll current editions of the books, however, number them in a slightly different order:\n\n1. The Magicians Nephew\n2. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\n3. The Horse and His Boy\n4. Prince Caspian\n5. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\n6. The Silver Chair\n7. The Last Battle\n\nThis order reflects the chronological sequence of events in the books themselves.\n\nLewis expressed a mild preference for this second, chronological order. In a letter written in 1957 to an American boy named Laurence, he wrote the following:\n\n‘I think I agree with your order {i.e. chronological} for reading the books more than with your mother’s. The series was not planned beforehand as she thinks. When I wrote The Lion I did not know I was going to write any more. Then I wrote P. Caspian as a sequel and still didn’t think there would be any more, and when I had done The Voyage I felt quite sure it would be the last. But I found as I was wrong. So perhaps it does not matter very much in which order anyone read them. I’m not even sure that all the others were written in the same order in which they were published.\n\nQuoted in “Letters to Children”\n\nOn this last point, scholars who have written about Narnia agree: the books were not published in the order that they were written. The writing order appears to have been\n\n1: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\n2: (Abandoned version of Magicians Nephew)\n3: Prince Caspian\n4: Voyage of the Dawn Treader\n5: Horse and His Boy\n6: Silver Chair\n7: Magicians Nephew\n8: Last Battle"

"Books to read","Reticence narrative: Chris Krause, m July, yin","Flatness of character. Events are not interesting, but ordinary. The interest is in the dynamic. \n\nDo we want to solve the problem of people's risk or trauma? What if identifying the trauma satisfies the audiences desire to know or explain character. But isn't enough to heal the trauma for the character. \n\nNot sharing your trauma is not an insincerity but generosity to protect them. \n\nRole of the audience--their feelings that they cannot solve the problem or get closure. \n\nNoise of the violence of the ordinary. \n\nWe disapear Scott Haynes. \n\nArchive of tenderness. Audience can be prompted by artwork. If you can bear the trauma then you can hold the tenderness. \n\n\nReticence of intimacy- showing up to withhold. Invent form of intimacy. Good manners with curiosity, but not seem crazy. \n\nUnderperformance. Not being known. Not being openly intimate. \n\nKeep lack of enthusiasm under cover-capitalistic emotional demands. To be proper for a situation we have to perform. \n\nIf someone is inscrutable than thy take away power from others. Are they doing nothing or being judgmental or resisting. \n\nConsumption of bodies or music, entitlement in assuming flat Affect ( where things are not interesting or beautiful).  Wooden ness or flat affect? We can read it. But we have to try to reach beyond that. Or else we will miss the moment of connection and understanding. When is it just shyness? (Students in class--aggressive silence or just thoughtful. No feedback. Defensive inscrutable. Or thruthiness. Doorman's music is bad but has ""a general truth"". \n\nGood luck with the sincerity problem. If you trust you have to act as though you trust. Psychosis of the encounter. Who is exposed in an encounter? How do I show up to any situation with an other?  Can we be analysists if all the options of a situation. \n\nAudience: reticence but what of the close up in film of flat affect? David hoveny- close up is like being in bed because you cannot see whole person's face.  Fantasy is not tied to image that is realistic, but trauma or positive fantasy has images that can be unrealistic. \nWRITE WITH CLOSE UP OR RETRACT THAT POV. \n\nThink of what artwork opens up rather than what audience receives. \n\nHow does the time period shape the forces of the characters. \n\nAGGRESSORS WHO ARE ABSENT- political power controlling ordinary. ABORTION LAWS. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPleasure doesn't mean felling good, it is a state you want to continue. (Berlant's book Female Complaint)\n\nWhat is the genre of the non-encounter? Reticence has a place. Event of a form if reticence. Ordinary bourgeois aesthetic gift that encourages gift without reciprocation or response.  Aggressiveness? \n\n\n\n\n\n"

"Books to read","Быков: Десять книг, от которых невозможно оторваться","http://echo.msk.ru/programs/odin/1568788-echo/\n\n «Назовите десять книг, от которых не оторваться». Хороший вопрос. Могу. Наверное. Но, как вы понимаете, я из личного опыта только могу это сделать.\n\nСтругацкие, «Попытка к бегству»; Пушкин, «Капитанская дочка»… Вы меня простите за этот разброс, это нормальная история. Да, я из разных эпох буду называть. Стивенсон, «Странная история доктора Джекила и мистера Хайда»; Уайльд, «Портрет Дориана Грея»; де Костер, «Легенда об Уленшпигеле»; Набоков, «Приглашение на казнь», потому что до последнего момента не знаешь, казнят или нет, а потом не знаешь, казнили или нет. Как вариант – «Ultima Thule», пожалуйста, если вам нужны более краткие вещи. Вообще Набоков – один из немногих авторов, за которых берёшься с гарантией, что будет интересно. Это я пять назвал. Сейчас ещё пять, наверное, назову.\n\nВиктор Франкл – любая книга, потому что это как будто тебя изнутри взрывает какая-то граната, он так тебя анализирует; любую книгу можно рекомендовать. Это я называю, ещё раз говорю, те вещи, от которых я сам не мог оторваться. Стивен Кинг, «Сияние», конечно.\n\nИз российских… Я пытаюсь вспомнить просто за последнее время. Ну, конечно, мне было не оторваться в своё время от «Чапаева и Пустоты», потому что я всё время ждал, что мне сейчас откроется истина, сейчас он мне смысл жизни расскажет. Ну, «Чапаев и Пустота» – может, и не самый характерный пример. А вот «Generation „П“», да, я назвал бы, там всё время смешно, всё время интересно. Трифонов – пожалуй, я назвал бы, конечно, или «Нетерпение» (лучший исторический роман, который я знаю), или лучшую из «Московских повестей» – «Другую жизнь» – очень страшная вещь, очень увлекательная, совершенно не оторваться, потому что очень плотная фраза, всё время что-то происходит. Ну, у меня есть определённая слабость к триллерам.\n\nЯ бы назвал Гофмана, конечно, любой рассказ, в особенности «Песочного человека» – по-моему, не оторваться абсолютно. Лермонтов, конечно, «Герой нашего времени» – книга, которая абсолютно безотрывно читается. Из Толстого я назвал бы «Смерть Ивана Ильича» или «Отца Сергия». Мы совершенно солидарны с Денисом Драгунским, мы считаем, что «Отец Сергий» – лучшая повесть, написанная по-русски. И привет Денису, если он меня сейчас слушает. И я бы назвал, знаете, как вариант… Я сейчас с всё большим напряжением и невероятным интересом перечитываю Аксёнова, «Остров Крым». Книга, в которой оказалось столько заложено глубины невероятной, столько ума! И так она причудливо сбывается."
"Books to read","Хагакурэ — Затерянное в листве","Рек. Быковым (тут: http://echo.msk.ru/programs/odin/1568788-echo/):\n\nЭто книга японского монаха… Не монаха, конечно, а японского самурая, который по окончании своей самурайской карьеры в период полной аскезы и одиночества формулирует главные цели жизни. Мне кажется, что главные ценности, изложенные в «Хагакурэ», которые так ценил Мисима и многие другие замечательные люди… Там, собственно, ценность одна: «Во всех ситуациях выбора предпочитай смерть. Это нетрудно. Исполнись решимости и действуй. Действовать надо так, как будто прыгаешь в холодную воду»."
