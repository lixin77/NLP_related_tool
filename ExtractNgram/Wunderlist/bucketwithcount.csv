If you find yourself going up Cowles 2 or three times in order for a better workout, try hiking to Pyle's Peak instead. Once you find yourself atop Cowles, head towards the radio tower and you should immediately see a sign for Pyle's Peak. It adds about another 4 miles round trip to your hike and offers much steeper inclines than Cowles. And at the peak I find it to be an even better view than atop Cowles. I go to Cowles Mtn. often, and I hike Pyle's Peak every time. I'm surprised more people don't take advantage of it! Go check it out!!!"

Readers of this blog have lost 100-200 pounds without too much trouble. \nGetting your mom or dad to take you seriously? To stop eating white bread or drinking 64-ounce sodas? That can seem impossible.  \nLoved ones — whether family, friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, spouses, or otherwise — can be sensitive. The people who need help most often won’t accept it, especially from those closest to them. \nSo what to do? \nThis post gives a real-world example from Darya Pino Rose, PhD.  I’ve known and followed Darya for years. Her PhD is in neuroscience from USCF, and she champions a whole-food-based approach to nutrition that avoids pills and powders. This combination produces fascinating results. \nThe below story, from her new book Foodist, shows exactly how she transformed her dad’s health without butting heads with him… and how you can do the same for your loved ones. \nDo you have any tricks that have worked with your family or friends? Please share in the comments! \nNote: For the purposes of this post, a “foodist” is someone who uses real food and real science to lose weight permanently. \nEnjoy… \nEnter Darya \nEating like a “foodist” does not doom you to being ostracized from your friends and family. This post will teach you how to lightheartedly deflect your critics and gently nudge (but not annoy) those loved ones you hope will adopt better eating habits.  \nThis is tricky business, but it can be done. \nHow To Win Over Friends and Influence Family \nIt’s hard to see loved ones suffer as a result of their eating habits. Traditional whole foods have been out of fashion for so long that many of our parents and sometimes even our grandparents are completely unaware of the negative health effects caused by the foods they grew up loving. As they age, however, these habits start to take their toll, and we must watch as their health deteriorates. A medical emergency that brings them face-to-face with reality is sometimes what it takes for them to make changes. Other times even that isn’t enough. \nUnfortunately, changing the habits of another person is even more difficult than changing your own. Stubbornness, pride, and ignorance can prevent people from even listening to advice that could save their lives, and for whatever reason age tends to compound these particular traits. Pushing a message that people don’t want to hear can cause them to dig in and fight even harder to preserve their way of life, straining and potentially destroying your relationship with them. When dealing with someone like this, it’s first essential to accept the fact that there may be nothing you can do for him or her. No matter how badly you may desire to help, a person has to want to change and cannot be forced. \nBut still, change can happen. Despite my close relationship with my father and his enthusiasm about my career path, I didn’t expect him to ever alter the way he ate. My dad had suffered from depression since I was in high school, and his outlook got even worse after my mother passed away in a car accident in 2003. Like most people, he had developed the habit of eating processed and fast foods starting in the early 1990s, and as his depression grew deeper, the effort he put into feeding and taking care of himself waned. \n“In general, I did not want to continue living and didn’t think I would. With all the health problems I was having, and especially after your mom died—that was a really hard thing for me to deal with—and I thought it would be better if I was gone too,” he told me. \nAfter a series of serious medical emergencies that nearly took his life on three occasions, I had nearly given up hoping for a turnaround, even though he was only in his fifties. But I continued to love him and share my passion for seasonal food whenever possible. \n“You were so understanding, you never put any pressure on me or tried to convince me to change, but you always gave me hope that things would get better, things would be better,” he recalled. \nFrom my perspective he had gone through enough and didn’t need me or anyone else telling him how to live out his life. If he didn’t want to live, I didn’t want to bug him about his blood pressure or eating habits. I just wanted to have as many happy and positive times with him as possible until whatever happened happened, and the last thing I wanted was to strain our relationship unnecessarily. I know my dad, and he is not one to do anything just because someone else, even me, thinks he should. Still my excitement about food and health was genuine, and I knew he had always been a fan of a good meal, so I continued to share what I was learning. \nMy cooking was the first thing that caught his attention. I made a point whenever visiting home in southern California to stop by the San Francisco farmers market before getting on the plane and bringing back something delicious. On one summer trip I brought home a small bag of padrón peppers, some good olive oil, and a crusty baguette. Padróns are small green peppers that are a common tapas dish in Spain and a seasonal delicacy for foodists in San Francisco. They are incredibly simple to prepare. All you have to do is heat some olive oil in a cast-iron pan and cook the peppers over medium heat until they blister and just start to brown. When they’re done, sprinkle them with some coarse sea salt and eat them with your fingers. Padróns have a deep pepper flavor, but are not usually spicy—except when they are. One out of every ten peppers is incredibly hot, so eating a bowl is a bit like playing Russian roulette with your tongue. \nMy dad has always been a fan of spicy foods, and I knew that padróns would be right up his alley. At his house I cooked them with a little more olive oil than usual, because it becomes infused with the oil from the peppers and tastes delicious. We used the bread to sop up the extra pepper oil and cool our mouths when we got burned on the spicy ones. My dad loved every bit of it and quietly started paying more attention whenever I mentioned food. \nHis next great epiphany was beets [ubersimple recipe at the end of this post]. All his life he had hated beets, and consequently I had never eaten them as a child. The first couple of times I tried them, even at nice restaurants, beets tasted a little off to me. Something about their flavor reminded me of dirt, and I could never get past that to enjoy their earthy sweetness. But I continued to sample them when they were available, hoping one day something would click. That day came one sunny afternoon at the house of a friend who was hosting a dinner party. We were having Dungeness crab for dinner, which I was totally excited about, but the main course was a long way off, so she put out a huge pile of roasted beets sprinkled with chèvre cheese and fresh mint as an appetizer. \nI was starving, so I started reluctantly picking at the giant pile with my fingers, since I didn’t want to scoop myself a serving of food I didn’t expect to like. I popped the first bite in my mouth and, yeah, it still tasted like beets. But I was hungry, so I tried another, this time with a good portion of mint and cheese on it. After a few chews, it hit me. “Whoa, this is good,” I said to myself. Something about the fresh-tasting mint and the creamy cheese balanced the earthy flavor of the beets and transformed them into something I could appreciate. I proceeded to put a hefty dent in the beet mountain, leaving bright pink stains all over my fingers. Beets had finally made it onto my beloved vegetables list, and I started making my own version of the recipe at home. \nProud of my recent conversion, I told my dad about my beet discovery during our next phone conversation. He replied skeptically, saying that he hated beets and always had. But I knew I was onto something and decided to include the recipe in our next Thanksgiving dinner, just so he could try it for himself. I made plenty of other dishes as well, just in case he really didn’t like the beets, but I followed my friend’s lead and set them out earlier than the rest of the food as an appetizer, knowing that someone with a hungry tummy couldn’t resist trying a bite. It worked. \n“When you made those beets I was like, ‘Wow, this is so unbelievable! So different from what I remember,’ ” he recalled. \nI was stoked, and my dad became a believer. At almost sixty years old, he developed a new appreciation for vegetables and real food (turns out the beets he grew up eating were always from a can), even the ones he thought he didn’t like. \n“It made eating and preparing healthy food much more fascinating,” he explained. “It became exciting to me to see what the possibilities are.” \nThe beets weren’t enough to change my dad’s habits, but he was starting to make the connection between good food and good health. More important, he was now convinced that vegetables and other healthy foods could taste amazing and that eating them would not be a sacrifice. He also began paying more attention to me and the things I would say and share on Facebook about the connections between food and wellness. \nThough he still didn’t care much about his own life or health, he was growing weary of feeling sick and drained all the time, and it was becoming obvious to him that his health (and possibly his diet) was the reason. After living for decades on processed foods, my dad had developed prediabetes and his blood sugar swings were having a terrible impact on his mood and energy levels. He also had dangerously high blood pressure, and in 2006 a mild stroke left him with a speech impediment tha"

It is a bit counter intuitive to be doing more speculative activities in a retirement account, but this approach supports my goals:\nAchieving good returns\nWith reasonable risks\nWhile compounding growth\nIf your money is in Roth accounts, all the better, but most people interested in trading in their IRAs are restricted to traditional IRAs.\nThere are restrictions on what trades you can do in an IRA account.  For example you can’t short a stock in an IRA account, but option restrictions have eased some over the years,  and market innovations like short ETFs (e.g., SH, SDS) have effectively bypassed some of the more onerous restrictions.    Brokers vary considerably in what they allow in IRA accounts, so pays to ask around.   Fidelity for example allows me to do some types of equity option spreads, while Schwab does not.   Covered calls and protective puts on long positions are broadly available within IRAs.  Interactive Brokers and TD Ameritrade both waive the 3 day settlement requirement on trades in IRAs so if you plan to do frequent trades they would definitely be worth a look."

"Bucket List","Bucket list before 30 elite daily all checklists",1,"If you think your time is running out and life is moving faster than you can keep up with, you’re not delusional, you’re perceptive. \n \nTime is moving faster and you are starting to lose the race. Before you realize it, you will wake up and be 30, looking back on things you wish you had accomplished, or at least attempted, in your twenties, when the world seemed a little less serious, you had much less to lose and many more excuses. \n \nSince we have no evidentiary proof of exactly what happens after we turn cold and blue, we can only assume that we’re only here once and there are no refunds. The world is what you make it and those who take risks are usually the ones who make it worthwhile. \n \nThey understand that now is not the time to be taking precautions. Your youth, unscathed looks and energy will not be around forever and time will just be laughing at you at the end, making sure you know that it won. \n \nBecause we don’t look back on our lives, especially our early youth, thinking about all the things we didn’t attempt or the rules we didn’t break. \n \nWe think back to the time we surprised ourselves, our best moments of courage and spontaneity. We think back to the happy accidents and the moments of fate that only presented themselves when we were being bold. We think back to the risks we took and the cautions we threw to the wind. \n \nSo do yourself a favor and stop being afraid. Be the bold adventurer you always saw for yourself in your twenties and make sure you accomplish these simple courageous acts by the time you hit 30 and your life will be full of more insight and a lot fewer regrets."

It is invigorating, to say the least, and it keeps your regrets at minimum. One of the reasons why we want to be successful is to actually fulfil our dreams or complete our bucket list, to look back on our life during old age with a warm smile rather than a frown. Feel free to put even the impossible things on your bucket list, and find the next best thing using your creativity. Whenever you reach a rough patch in your life, take a look at you bucket list and see what is the most plausible thing to do in order to restore your will power and keep going."

"Bucket List","Spiritual guidance notes-Elder Scott. See also  October 2009 conference.",1,"Warning signs of declining spirituality. More hardened as inappropriate scene in movie had minimal effect. I didnt feel as if my spirit had been offended or experience aversion to it. \n\nSacrament meeting becoming more difficult to focus and feel the spirit. I am the problem, the speakers have always been like that. \n\nI enjoy serving in the temple but even that has become a bit mundane and rote. I need to foster more of a spirit of worship and reverence to invite the spirit into my life.\n\nIncreasing problem with scripture study. Not only do I need to quarantine time but also eliminate distractions such as comptuer and phone. Need to hunger and thirst. Listening to devotionals and even conference talks are too passive. They are enrichment.\nNeed to actively seek spiritual knowledge and understanding.\n\nIt has been difficult from even before I was released as stake president with scripture study but I had many other opportunities to feel the spirit. Particularly whilst teaching. my callings now have made that more difficult. \n\nOne of the dangers of my professional life was always the type of things and people I would deal with on a daily basis. I knew I would need to fortify myself spiritually. I became slack through callings, basking  in the spiritual experiences I was having which fortified me, rather thand more actively building that spirituality.\n\nFurther I have had the mixed blessing of being successful at what I  do. I have been richly blessed in many ways and the Lord has prospered me so that I want for nothing materiarlly. But that brings ease and comfort which brings lack of diligence etc. Beware of pride! Learn from the Nephites. I can choose to be humble or let the Lord humble me.\n\nI need to make some changes or I am in danger of being led carefully into carnal security.\n\nRather than simply list off the obvious things I need to do I need to ponder and reflect and make it matter of meaningful and searching prayer and fasting. I also need to repent in the sense of turning back to the Lord."

"Bucket List","Learn how to meditate",1,"Kiring\n\nTM MANTRAS - SAVE YOUR DOLLARS!\n\nWhy would anyone pay maharishi $1000 for a word. In his early writings he said ""any word, even the word mike can be taken...we find that any sound can serve our purpose of training the mind to become sharp...we select only the suitable mantras of personal gods. Such mantras fetch to us the grace of personal gods.""\n\nIf you want the grace of Maharishi 's personal gods here is the technique.\n\n1) Pick a mantra from the following list used by *some* TM teachers:\n\nage mantra\n\n0-11 eng\n\n12-13 em\n\n14-15 enga\n\n16-17 ema\n\n18-19 ieng\n\n20-21 iem\n\n22-23 ienga\n\n24-25 iema\n\n26-29 shirim\n\n30-34 shiring\n\n35-39 kirim\n\n40-44 kiring\n\n45-49 hirim\n\n50-54 hiring\n\n55-54 hiring\n\n55-59 sham\n\n60- shama\n\n2) The technique is simple (it really is hypnosis): close your eyes - wait about half a minuet, then start thinking the mantra over and over again.\n\nAt the end of meditation stop thinking the mantra and wait about 2 minutes before opening the eyes.\n\nSome notes on correct meditation ( from the TM Checking notes)\n\n""In this meditation, we do not concentrate, we do not try to say the mantra clearly. Mental repetition is not a clear pronunciation, it is just a faint idea.\n\nWe don't try to make a rhythm of the mantra. We don't try to control thoughts. If a thought comes, we do not try to push it out. When we become aware that we are not thinking the mantra, then we quietly come back to the mantra.\n\nVery easily we think the mantra and if at any moment we feel that we are forgetting it, we should not try to persist in repeating it or try to keep on remembering it. Only very easily we start and take it as it comes and do not hold the mantra if it tends to slip away. The mantra may change in different ways. It can get faster or slower, louder or softer, clearer or fainter. Its pronunciation may change, lengthen or shorten or even may appear to be distorted or it may not appear to change at all. In every case, ewe take it as it comes, neither anticipating nor resiting change, just simple innocence.\n\nA word of warning: Many studies (the movement has tried to suppress) have found that approximately 40% of the people who practice TM develop adverse effects.\n\nIf it helps do it, if you have any problems S T O P. Because TM is a religion (The courts in the US have ruled it to be) for a TM teacher to admit that TM is not good for you would be like a Christian saying belief in Jesus is not good for you, it will never happen.\n\nWell you just saved $1000.\n\nMost TM'ers get advanced techniques of TM about every 18 months. They also cost $1000. The advanced techniques of TM are as follows.\n\n1st Aing Namah\n\n2nd Shri Aing Namah\n\n3rd Shri Aing Namah Namah\n\n4th Shri Shri Aing Namah Namah\n\n5th Shri Shri Aing Aing Namah Namah\n\n6th Shri Shri Aing Aing Namah Namah (The mantra is thought in the heart\n\narea of the body).\n\nShri = oh most beautiful\n\nAing = Hindu goddess saraswati\n\nNamah = I bow down\n\nThe TM-Sidhi program is posted under the topic (How much does the Siddhi's cost). $4000\n\nHappy trails or in TM speak JAI GURU DEV"

Entweder muss ein Lebensabschnitt zu Ende gebracht und ein neuer begonnen werden oder es gilt einen bestehenden Veränderungsprozess weiterzuführen. Die Chancen auf allen Ebenen zu wachsen und zu mehr Lebensqualität zu finden, stehen sehr günstig. Die Zeit des Wartens ist nun bald vorbei. Jetzt können nur noch Mutlosigkeit, Zweifel, Sorgen und Ängste das aufhalten, was längst überfällig ist. Der Bussard hilft Ihnen die Zweifel zu besiegen und Ängste loszulassen.\n\nFolgende spirituelle Hinweise sind als Botschaften zu verstehen, denen Sie jetzt gerade Beachtung schenken sollten und die von Ihnen auf Ihre individuelle Lebenssituation übertragen und interpretiert werden möchten. Entspannen Sie Ihren Körper und Ihren Geist und spüren Sie in sich nach, welche Gedanken, Ideen und Erkenntnisse sich dazu in Ihrem Bewusstsein einfinden werden:\n\nNeuanfang – Neuausrichtung\nDem Leben Vertrauen schenken\nMut zur Veränderung\nEigene Interessen, Talente und Bedürfnisse ernst nehmen\nKreative Ideen wollen in die Welt getragen werden\nSelbstheilungskräfte aktivieren\nSie haben die Kraft zu heilen\nDie anderen so nehmen, wie sie sind – keine Verurteilungen\nWeitblick durch Achtsamkeit\nProbleme können gelöst werden\nRichtig entscheiden mit Herz und Verstand\nEs heißt nun: intelligent Vorgehen\nEin Geheimnis kann für immer bewahrt werden oder Sie lüften es nun"

Hence, I should wake up ready and willing to work for that I want while striving for progress but not perfection. During the last month I've gained more flexibility alone that during tha last year because I've been stretching willingly and mindful of every position. I also seem not to be resistent and idle (lazy) about it. It is the moderate long-term work that will get me there. It must become a priority. Dont I get tired of soullessly trying?

"Bucket List","Active Listening – How to Truly Listen",1,"Active Listening – How to Truly Listen\n\nhttp://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LifeHack/~3/ljzY_D9Eci8/story01.htm\n\nDo you believe you a good listener and do others agree? If you don’t have that reputation, it’s not your fault: your brain is designed to predict what other people are going to say next. You are often so busy listening to your brain’s plotting and planning that you can’t hear what the other person is saying. A study conducted at Princeton University found that “speaker–listener neural coupling underlies successful communication”. If that was so much Greek to you, let’s state it more simply: when your brain starts acting like your conversational companion’s brain, you actually communicate. You won’t be surprised to hear that the study found there is generally a lag between what you hear and what you understand, and this is where we get into trouble. In the midst of that lag, we start predicting and supposing and guessing. Too often, we are still caught up in our own reverie as our conversation partner continues talking. The good doctors at Princeton would say that our brain activities decouple at that point and that as a result comprehension starts to plummet. This is the scientist’s way of saying, “You’re not listening.” Training Your Pet Brain The good news is that your brain works for you: rather than letting it just do what it’s programmed to do automatically, you can train it to do new tasks. The brain is the best pet you could ever hope for—it can be taught all kinds of tricks, and it loves to please its master. The trick to teaching your pet brain is concentration. Many folks find concentration to be taxing but that is because they approach it in the wrong way. While you can make yourself concentrate, sooner or later you will tire out and your brain will go back on autopilot. The result will be “neural decoupling”—that is, your brain will wander off on its own. Concentration is more properly approached passively rather than actively. Don’t make yourself concentrate; allow yourself to concentrate. Just hear what is said, observe the nonverbal cues like facial expressions and body language, absorb the tone and the pace of their speech. If you find you are distracted by other stimuli or by your own thoughts, be gentle with yourself. Just guide yourself back to hearing with no self-judgment. In fact, recognize that self-judgment itself is just another distracting thought. You will find with practice that these wanderings become less frequent. When you first attempt this, you will notice that you respond less quickly in conversation. People may not be used to you being this contemplative, so give them the chance to get used to it. Your responses will be more in tune with them, and everybody likes “in tune” better than “out of tune”. In short, they will feel heard by you like they have never felt it before. Brain Pattern Alignment If you do this, something fascinating happens, according to the doctors at Princeton. They did fMRI brain scans of the participants in their study and found that people’s brain wave patterns started to align as people actually listened. Not only did the lag between hearing and understanding vanish but the listeners started to anticipate what the other person was about to say before they said it. This is not the same as your autopilot guesses; instead, what they found is your brain pattern actually starts to match that of your partner in real time. When that happens, a strong connection occurs, understanding deepens between you, and real communication takes place. When you as the listener find yourself in the same state at the talker, you tend to move in tandem. People get a real charge out of being understood, so it is very much worth your effort to seek such an alignment. There is the practical benefit of receiving information as its imparter meant it to be received and additionally there is also an emotional connection that takes place. Even in mere business or transactional settings, there is value to such an emotional connection as it fosters trust and comfort. As a result, people believe in your sincerity and genuineness, which eases relations and lessens conflict. Your brain may not be so good at listening but that doesn’t mean you can’t be. Let it know who the boss is, and earn the reputation of being a good listener. Wouldn’t you like to have mind control over people? Wouldn’t it be great to have them do what you want?: The Secret to Getting People to Do What You Want The post Active Listening – How to Truly Listen appeared first on Lifehack.    \n\nSent by gReader "

As well as a mini cruise of the Amalfi Coast. Let me know if they need help with this.\n \nIf they love cooking, I may suggest a couple of local genuine cooking classes. It’s a lovely experience indeed.\n \nIf they like thermal baths, Ischia Island is the place to go! Terme Negombo and Poseidon are the best.\n \nIf they like trekking, the panoramic Path of the Gods offers breathtaking views!\n \nIf they love wine, we can arrange a marvelous tour of the Irpinia – the beautiful hilly countryside that boasts the production of delicious local wines.\n \nExcavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum are a must! The Greek temples of Paestum are very charming, too.\n \nThe above list is just to give them a general idea. The closest airport is Naples Capodichino, but they can easily move from Rome via fast train (Italo or Frecciarossa) to Salerno (the biggest city of the coast, where I live) and then move by private transfer or bus.\n \nDaily ferries to Capri available from Salerno, Amalfi and Positano.\n \nIf you need my help with booking extra activities and/or transfers and/or hotel room, just let me know.\n \nKindest regards,\nValentina"

"Bucket List","Exploring sea caves (Thailand)",1,"Thailand's coast hides some of the most beautiful sea caves or hongs, which the adventure-loving traveller can access by canoe. Click through for a guide to the best hongs, and tours that help you explore them.\n\nWelcome to the world of hongs – sanctuaries within limestone karst islands of the Andanman Sea. Hong means room in the Thai language, and these unusual “rooms” are in fact sinkholes within rugged karst cliffs only accessible through sea caves.\n\nWords by Tatyana Leonov; photography by Evan Dickson\n\n Phang Nga Bay on the west coast of the southern Thai peninsula\n...has been flooded by the sea over time, leaving limestone karst plain fully submerged. Today however, this beautiful part of Thailand is famed for being home to some of the most striking karst formations, that now rise dramatically out of the sea. Inside some of these cliffs is where you’ll find hongs and their unique lagoons. Phuket is the main base for excursions and most hong tours start off on a day charter.\n\nAs the sun begins to set on another day\n...the John Gray’s Sea Canoe charter is often the only large vessel peacefully navigating the sea. Guests can take in the glorious colours that dusk brings as the suns rays flicker across the crystal blue water and craggy karst cliffs. Once the sun has set the group visits one more hong with their colourful floral offerings. Inside everyone lights their candles and places their flower arrangements into the water. Then the guides ask everyone to stop talking and turn off their head torches, and with only candlelight and starlight the hong somehow seems even more magical. (The writer travelled as a guest of John Gray's Sea Canoe)\n\nhttp://travelinsider.qantas.com.au/thailand/phuket/photo-gallery/exploring-sea-caves-in-thailand/phang-nga-bay-on-the-west-coast-of-the-southern-thai-peninsula"

It is invigorating, to say the least, and it keeps your regrets at minimum. One of the reasons why we want to be successful is to actually fulfil our dreams or complete our bucket list, to look back on our life during old age with a warm smile rather than a frown. Feel free to put even the impossible things on your bucket list, and find the next best thing using your creativity. Whenever you reach a rough patch in your life, take a look at you bucket list and see what is the most plausible thing to do in order to restore your will power and keep going."

You have the sweetest soul that matches perfectly with mine. I love how smart you are. You impress me everyday with your knowledge. I love your humbleness and I know how successful you're going to be in life. I couldn't ask for someone better than you and If I'm lucky enough i  really hope you're the man I end up with. Idk if this makes any sense but I'm not use to being treated so well. I told you my ex treated me horribly and always neglected me. He never paid any attention to me.  I was always begging him just to hang out with me. So I'm really not use to receiving so much affection and attention. I think I need a little time to adjust to it. It's a little overwhelming for me. Not in a bad way at all I just don't know how to handle it. I think we shouldn't see each other every single day bc I like being able to miss you. Please don't take any of this in the wrong way because I just wanwant to us to work and I'll be devastated if i lose you. "

Please improve this article by introducing more precise citations. (January 2013) Roadsign for the Romantic Road near Fuchstal in German and Japanese\n\nRoadsign near Peiting, note the Alps at the background\n\nThe Romantic Road (German: Romantische Straße) is a ""theme route"" devised by promotion-minded travel agents in the 1950s. It describes the 350 kilometres (220 mi) of highway between Würzburg and Füssen in southern Germany, specifically in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, linking a number of picturesque towns and castles. In medieval times it was a trade route that connected the center of Germany with the south. Today this region is thought by many international travellers to possess ""quintessentially German"" scenery and culture, in towns and cities such as Nördlingen, Dinkelsbühl and Rothenburg ob der Tauber and in castles such as Burg Harbur... \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_Road"

"Bucket List","Learn a month-long massage training",1,"Conclusion from below: Go to Art Of Massage (private 2-person class) or take class in India (http://www.tyms.in/index.php).  I’m still not sure if THAI massage is what I want.  Learning massage that doesn’t need clothes taken off is great (family and friends), and I could take a supllemental oil massage class.\n\nhttp://www.feel-first.com/massage-therapy-schools-in-chiang_mai.html\n\nhttp://artofmassage.webs.com\nhttp://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293917-i9325-k4642754-Help_Choosing_Chang_Mai_Thai_Massage_Program-Chiang_Mai.html\n\nHi Yoga chica\n\ni have been studying TYM with many schools in Thailand and one in India. I have been to ITM, SMH, TMC first as these were well known. After spending a lot of time and money i have come to a list of attributes a good massage school should have. I have found only one school (School of Thai Yoga Massage INDIA) www.tyms.in in India that fits the bill. Its a small school but the teacher Cyriac speaks fluent english knows anatomy and has great technique. so here is my list if it helps.\n\n1. Good communication in English. If the teacher cannot explain why something is being done then there is no point in just seeing a demo. At TYMS the faculty speak very good English and answered all my questions from an anatomical perspective.\n\n2. The teacher must work on you and you must work on the teacher too. Otherwise you will never understand how much pressure to put or where the points and meridians are. At TYMS the class strength was limited to four students per teacher and i experienced every sequence from the teacher and then got to practice several times on teacher during the course.\n\n3. Does the course allow you repeat the course at a reasonable cost. At TYMs i stayed for another two weeks and repeated level 1 and 2 again for FREE. I have met many students from ITM who after two years still practice with a workbook.\n\n4. Memorisation: because schools charge you for repeating the course it is in their interest not teach you properly especially not insist on memorizing the sequence. I found it a bit childish that Cyriac insisted on me memorizing the sequence several times. too my surprise after i did it my technique improved so much that did not use the book any more and was able to focus on my breath and my technique much more.\n\n5. Cyriac used some very cool 3D anatomy software that allowed us to see the connection muscles were making with each other and the internal workings of the human body . That helped me better visualise what i was working on.\n\ntoday i have a flourishing practice in Aukland and while i am grateful to all my teachers but i want to say that cyriac at www.tyms.in moved my practice up several notches. go to india the land where thai massage was born and find cyriac. Best thing is the cost is the same as any of these thai schools and is accredited by THAI. All the best"

To help me learn I could talk with my step mother, watch movies, and deal with the people who we buy stuff from.\n\n3. Japanese\n>>>> I could start watching anime without having to read the subtitles and it would help me be productive overall. I would eventually love to go to japan on a vacation, and this would help me operate independently there. To help me learn, I could watch more anime.\n\n4. French\n>>>> This would help me to speak with more people. I believe that many people know French, including many Africans due to colonial days. To help me learn I could watch movies and speak with Candace\n\n5. Spanish\n>>>> This would help me speak with a HUGE population that is literally exploding around me. This means i could speak and understand more people around me. To help me learn I could listen to spanish radio, watch movies, and also listen to those around me speaking it.\n\n6. Arabic\n>>>> This is a huge population that is only growing and taking up more and more of the world stage news. In order to help me learn, I could watch news, listen to radio, and also watch movies.\n\n7. Vietnamese \n>>>> This would be extremely helpful for when I'm around Candace's parents and would also give me a way to talk to them that wasn't as hindered as the english they currently speak. To help me learn i could watch videos and eat at vietnamese restaurants.\n\n8. Russian\n>>>> A huge demographic of people, but I have no knowledge of any good way to learn or get help learning this.\n\n9. Hindi\n>>>> Another huge demographic with little help learning. I could watch movies from Bollywood without the english dubs and things like that, but otherwise I have no real idea of how to get much help besides occasional restaurant visits."

Danach sind wir mit dem öffentlichen Bus (dauert einen Tag, daher weniger zu empfehlen) über die Gebirge in die Wüstenstadt Zaghora gefahren (Übernachtung im Hotel La Fibule du Draa - sehr zu empfehlen). Dort haben wir eine geführte 2-Tagestour mit dem Allrad in die Wüste gemacht, anschließend ging es wieder mit dem Bus zurück über Marrekesch nach Essaouira, einer bezaubernden kleinen Hafenstadt (aber auch touristisch). Dort haben wir eine kleine Suite in Jacks Apartments gehabt, sehr schön - sehr zu empfehlen. \n\n \n\nHallo! Wir waren im Oktober auch zum ersten mal in Marokko und haben jede Stunde genossen. Wir sind nach Marrakech geflogen und haben dort 3 Nächte in einem wunderschönen Riad verbracht (Riad Tizwa). Vormittags und Abends haben wir die Stadt erkundet, am Nachmittag im Riad Ruhe und traumhaft entspannte Athmosphäre genossen. Nach Marrakech sind wir nach Essaouira gefahren. Mit dem Bus kein Problem und günstig, wenn mindestens einen Tag vorher die Tickets reserviert werden. Das haben wir leider verpasst, sind dann aber für ca. 70 Euro per Taxi sehr angenehm gefahren. In Essaouira geht es viel entspannter und weniger turbulent als in Marrakech zu und die frische Meerluft tut nach dem Stadtaufenthalt richtig, richtig gut. Wir haben uns in Essaouira im Riad Baladin eingemietet und die dortige Managerin Nicole ist mehr als ein Glücksgriff. Neben der deutschen Sprache ist vor allem ihre herzliche, unkomplizierte Art sehr, sehr wohltuend. Wir hatten in Essaouira traumhafte Tage - und als Kontrast zu Marrakech fanden wir es grandios. Zurück gings dann wieder mit dem Taxi an den Flughafen in Marrakech (Bus ist natürlich auch jederzeit möglich). Also abschliessend: wir fanden die Kombi von Stadt, Trubel und Hitze mit der gelassenen Stimmung am Meer traumhaft und für eine Woche genau richtig! Ohne Stress konnten wir viele verschiedene und nachhaltig positive Eindrücke mit nach Hause nehmen. Viel Spass und Grüsse!"

The exhibition, which features designers such as Christopher Kane, Rei Kawakubo, Karl Lagerfeld, Helmut Lang, Gianni Versace and Vivienne Westwood, includes nearly 100 designs for men and women ranging from original punk garments to recent designs that use punk elements: paillettes replaced by safety pins and feathers by razor blades. The clothes in the exhibition are accompanied by period music videos from iconic punk bands including the Ramones, Sex Pistols and The Clash."

"Bucket List","Bangkok",1,"1. Get a daily ticket ""ride all you like"" tourist pass [web ⇒] (130 baht per day)\n2. Chao Phraya Express Boat - blue flagged Tourist Boat which stops at a different subset of piers, offers commentary in English and charges 150 baht for a day pass. \n3. The Saen Saep Express Boat serves the long Saen Saep Canal,\n4. Rattanakosin Tour — a quick tour along Bangkok's famed historic district\n5. Yaowarat and Phahurat Tour — a full-day walking tour through this multicultural district\n6. 9 Temples tour — a day trip to 9 most sacred temples in Bangkok\n\nBANGKOK IN 3 days\nEXPLORE BANGKOK’S PAST\nDAY ONE\nHistorians disagree on the subject of precisely when the story of Bangkok begins, but there’s no question about where: Start your three days in Bangkok by traipsing through the Bangkok historical districts of Thonburi and Rattanakosin. Take the BTS SkyTrain to Saphan Taksin station, then board a Chao Phraya Express boat to Memorial Bridge, which you’ll cross into Thonburi, established as Thailand’s capital in the 18th century.\n\nThonburi is a decidedly local (and relatively quiet) part of Bangkok, which makes it a great way to get acquainted with the city. After starting at the stark white Wat Prayoon, continue walking north along the river to sites like the Portuguese-Catholic Santa Cruz Church, an unnamed Chinese Shrine, ending up at Wat Kalayanamitr. Once you finish saying “Sawasdee” to the massive Buddha at Wat Kalayanamitr, walk to the dock out front and wait for the boat to take you across the river into Rattanakosin.\n\nYour boat lets you off at Pak Khlong Talat, which just so happens to be the site of Bangkok’s 24-Hour Flower Market. (Tip: If you happen to take advantage of this market at night, make sure and visit nearby Yaowarat Road, Bangkok’s de-facto Chinatown.) After getting your flower fix, walk north along the main road, stopping first at Wat Pho, the temple of the reclining Buddha. Head north to Wat Suthat and the Giant Swing, then head back to the pier in front of Wat Pho to cross back over to Thonburi.\n\nYour boat lets you off at Pak Khlong Talat, which just so happens to be the site of Bangkok’s 24-Hour Flower Market. (Tip: If you happen to take advantage of this market at night, make sure and visit nearby Yaowarat Road, Bangkok’s de-facto Chinatown.) After getting your flower fix, walk north along the main road, stopping first at Wat Pho, the temple of the reclining Buddha. Head north to Wat Suthat and the Giant Swing, then head back to the pier in front of Wat Pho to cross back over to Thonburi.\n\nHere – and specifically at Wat Arun, or “Temple of the Dawn” – is where the sun sets on your first day in Bangkok, quite literally. Make sure to scale one of Wat Arun’s massive (but steep!) stupas, not only to marvel at the detail of its architecture, but for a view of both ancient and modern Bangkok (which you’ll explore tomorrow). As the colors in the sky change, you’ll also be able to see ancient Bangkok’s most famous landmark, the Grand Palace, which in my opinion is better enjoyed from afar. Take the Chao Phraya Express boat back to Saphan Taksin and connect to the SkyTrain or, if you’re feeling hungry, continue walking northward through Thonburi (or even hire a taxi/tuk-tuk) to the riverfront Supatra River House.\n\nDAY TWO: MEET MODERN BANGKOK\n\nNowhere is the size and scale of modern Bangkok more evident than Lumphini Park (BTS Sala Daeng/MRT Silom), a massive green space whose contrast with the sprawling skyline behind it dwarfs just about every other city on the planet. Lumphini Park, as I detail in the Bangkok guide I wrote for CreateTrips, is not only a great place for spotting the monitor lizards native to Bangkok, but is also a great place to relax before exploring hectic modern Bangkok.\n\nIt’s also a great place to orient yourself, being that Lumphini Park is sandwiched between modern Bangkok’s four main areas: Silom, Sukhumvit, Sathorn and Siam, the former two being entertainment districts that don’t really come alive until light, the third an exciting (if, for tourists, superfluous) business district and the latter home to major Bangkok shopping establishments, from commercial malls like Siam Paragon and CentralWorld (BTS Siam), to fake shoppers’ paradise MBK Center at BTS National Stadium. Speaking of shopping, if you happen to be in Bangkok on the weekend, take the BTS SkyTrain to its northern terminus at Mo Chit to explore Chatuchak Weekend Market, the largest weekend market in the world.\n\nThis is not to say there aren’t relics of old Bangkok in its modern center. The Jim Thompson House, for example, is a traditional Thai home that pays homage to the American man who revitalized the Thai silk industry, and is located just steps from MBK Center. Likewise, the Ratchaprasong Intersection is located at the corner of busy Ratchadamri and Rama I roads (BTS Chit Lom), but is home to a Hindu shrine, among other spiritual relics. Naturally, many temples and other spiritual sites can be found amid the skyscrapers of Bangkok’s futuristic city center.\n\nSpeaking of skyscrapers, rooftop bars such as Zoom (on top of Anantara Sathorn Hotel, BTS Chong Nonsi) and Red Sky Lounge (on top of CentralWorld, BTS Chit Lom) allow you to enjoy snacks and cocktails while looking out onto the incredible Bangkok skyline. Or, if you’re craving nighttime delights closer to ground level, you could head to Patpong Night Market along Silom Road, Soi Cowboy along Sukhumvit Road (BTS Asok) or the aforementioned Khao San Road backpackers district. For gay nightlife, head to Silom Soi 4, with “soi” being a word for a small street in Thai. Alternatively, head to BTS Saphan Taksin and instead of boarding a Chao Phraya Express boat, take the one marked “Asiatique” to head to Bangkok’s waterfront entertainment complex of the same name."
